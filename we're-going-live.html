    <p>I'm imagining the sound of an old-school electric motor grinding its way up to nominal
speed. Can you hear it? That low groan trying ever-so-hard to come up to a comfortable
range.</p>
<p>I suppose I should step back and introduce myself. I'm Joe Stanley, at the time of writing,
I'm twenty-three years old, and a graduate of the University of Idaho with both a Bachelors
and Masters in Electrical Engineering. I work with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL)
in Pullman, Washington. I spend far too much time trying to automate things that would have
been faster to do by hand; but I guess that's engineering. I'm an avid Pythonista, and I'm
always trying to &quot;convert&quot; others into the language. I also spend a great deal of time
developing and maintaining IEC 61131-3 libraries for SEL.</p>
<p>I have far too many ideas and thoughts, so I think it's time to start sharing them. If it's
somewhere on the scale between sustainability and automation, I'm probably interested in it.</p>
<p>My hope is that I might start sharing thoughts, ideas, projects, and guides here on this
blog. Now, I'm sure you can hear that motor grinding up to speed!</p>
