Summary: I've often written about the various bits of project work pertaining to my Engineering Capstones. I'm proud to say that they've made some really impressive steps, and for that I'm both thankful and very proud. But until now, it's been a bit of a mess trying to put all that information in one place. Now, I'm getting better about that!

Yes, I've written a bunch of blogposts about the Engineering Capstone project work that students have been conducting at the University of Idaho. If you don't
believe me, or you've forgotten, go take a look at the [summary of posts](https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/category/capstone.html).

There's a lot of really cool things that they've done in the past, but I've not done the best keeping up with it all and putting it in one *central* place so that
folks can just find the stuff they're interested in. Well, I've finally gotten around to updating my [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) instance to have some nice pages
about all that information.

More than anything, it's a "landing place" for most of the other information that's already been culminated. Regardless, it's a nice face-lift!
