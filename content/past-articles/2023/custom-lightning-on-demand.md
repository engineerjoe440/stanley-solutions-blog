Summary: Clearly I haven't written in a while. I've been busy with all manner of projects, of late. However, since this will be mostly video and image posting, I thought it couldn't hurt to get a quick article up.

And yet another halloween has come...

This year, I added a new Shelly control to be able to support Home-Assistant based control of my front porch lights. Notably, it's really only the ability to turn them on or off, not changing any of the special effects settings. If you want to see what that's all about, go [check out my article from last year](https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/spooky-scary-porch-projects.html).

Always fun, and now I think there's a few new tricks that I want to add to my bag.... Hmm... gonna have to start working on those soon.
