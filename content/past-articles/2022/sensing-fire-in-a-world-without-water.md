Summary: The world we live in is congested with controversy; left-vs-right, masks-vs-maskless, us-vs-them. So many arguments, one thing that we don't need to argue about is that there are parts of the U.S. that don't have much access to water, and that there are parts of the U.S. that also face some real challenges with wildfire.

Wildfire, water-shortages, weird-weather; all sounds like some dystopian sci-fi novel, right?

Scary that some of that is appearing across the United States, isn't it?

Yeah. Now, weather you're a "climate change subscriber," or not, I think there's a lot to be said about the challenges the world faces.
If for nothing else, we've got to figure out where to get all that water from, and we need to figure out what we're going to do to help
face the challenges of wildfire in our increasingly populous world.

I've written in the past about some of the project work that I'm sponsoring at the University of Idaho, and I wanted to highlight that
briefly while also pointing out some interesting things popping up from around the world.

### What's Happening with Water?

I really don't have much to say here, but I did want to highlight an article that shows some of the drama of the water shortages that
are appearing across the American Southwest.

Makes me wish there were other ways I could get involved in researching additional technology in this area.

### What's New

This year is my second year acting as the sponsor for a wildfire detection system, and I have to say, I'm stoked. This is a very
exciting project, and has a lot of potential. If you want to read more about the concept or tech, go check out my articles on
[finding fire and making it](/finding-fire-and-making-it.html), [hearing fires while seeing smoke](/hearing-fires-while-seeing-smoke),
or [detecting fires with sound](/detectinf-fires-with-sound).

What's new and exciting right now, is the team's approach, using inspiration from Mother Nature. They're using some designs for their
drop-payload which were inspired by a [Samara leaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_%28fruit%29) so they can make the payload
drop in a safe, and controlled fashion. Now, this isn't exactly a novel idea, there's a few others who have done similar things:

* [HELICOPTER SEED ROBOT CAN ALSO DROP LIKE A ROCK](https://hackaday.com/2021/08/07/helicopter-seed-robot-can-also-drop-like-a-rock/)
* [SPINNING SEEDS INSPIRE SINGLE-BLADED HELICOPTERS](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20045-spinning-seeds-inspire-single-bladed-helicopters/)

Still, this is brand new to us, and so far as I'm aware, it's a new way to drop materials as a deployment technique. I'm very proud of
the team's work, and I'm so excited to see where they'll take this project!

Hopefully, I'll be keeping more updates coming; but let's be honest, I'm in charge of the updates, so they might be a bit sparse, or even
a bit all-over-the-place.
