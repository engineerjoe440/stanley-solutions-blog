Summary: Everyone's got their new favorite podcast these days. So here, let me list all of my favorites!


I've been asked a lot lately what tech podcasts I listen to, so I thought I'd briefly summarize them all
right here!

Where should I even begin, though? Perhaps I'll start with the security side of computers...

#### *"Darknet Diaries"*

One of my favorites was recommended to me by a colleague. [*Darknet Diaries*](https://darknetdiaries.com/)
is an excellent podcast covering everything in the darker side of the internet. No, don't worry... You
don't need to download a TOR browser to listen. This podcast covers everything from hackers to penetration
testers; everything in the cybersecurity space.

Jack Rhysider, the host of *Darknet Diaries* covers a wide variety of stories in the tech and security
world, and yet, somehow he manages to make each story captivating for all audiences. I really do mean **all**
audiences, too. I've even had my mother and other non-techy folks listen to episodes and find some value.


#### *"Security Now"*

For those interested in the deep-tech-intricacies of cybersecurity, Steve Gibson and
[*Security Now*](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now) digs deep into the meat-and-potatoes; or should I say,
they bytes-and-bits of the stuff. Covering everything from *Boot-Hole* and *Print-Nightmare* to the latest
in [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) and new security practices for IoT devices. *Security Now* is a
great podcast for the tech-minded and security-interested.


Now... Perhaps I should switch gears to the more programming-focused side of the table. After all, I've got
a number of podcasts that I listen to in this arena too!

#### *"Python Bytes"*

    width="150" alt="Python Bytes" align="left">

By far, my favorite of the programming-pods, [*Python Bytes*](https://pythonbytes.fm/) covers the latest news
in the Python programming language and the areas of the tech world that Python supports. Everything from web
servers to data-science, from embedded Python to the data-center!

*Python Bytes* is a little on the shorter side; at least when compared with the other podcasts I've listed so
far. Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken cover all the latest-and-greatest Python modules and techniques with at
least one guest host every week.


#### *"Talk Python to Me"*

Another podcast from Michael Kennedy (one of the hosts of the aforementioned *Python Bytes*) is
[*Talk Python to Me*](https://talkpython.fm). It's a little longer than its sister podcast, and goes into
greater detail in the technology or topic of interest. Michael brings on a variety of fantastic guests, all
of which help discuss the latest news.


#### *"Test and Code"*

Brian Okken's other podcast, much like *Talk Python to Me* is a companion podcast to *Python Bytes*. Brian,
the author of *"Python Testing with pytest: Simple, Rapid, Effective, and Scalable"* covers the intricacies
of testing code effectively. [*Test and Code*](https://testandcode.com/) is a great podcast, and is a little
on the shorter side, so it makes for quick listening!


#### *"Coder Radio"*

[*Coder Radio*](https://coder.show/) is a discussion-based show talking all about "the art and business of
programming". It's often very opinionated, but let's be honest... Have you ever met a programmer who isn't?
A Jupiter Broadcasting family podcast, *Coder Radio* talks everything from Python to Objective-C, Rust to
Ruby, GO to JS.


Now, getting into the rest of the tech-stack, we simply must talk about Linux! And here, I've got quite the
assortment of Linux podcasts... Let's get started.

#### *"Linux Unplugged"*

    width="150" alt="Linux Unplugged" align="right">

By far, my favorite Linux pod, [*Linux Unplugged*](https://linuxunplugged.com/) covers everything in the
community of Linux; from new technologies to community happenings. Chris Fisher and Wes Payne bring the best
of the community together and make a fantastic weekly show as part of the Jupiter Broadcasting family. Always
keeping high-energy, enthusiastic goals, and a hopeful spirit; Chris and Wes open up with the community every
Tuesday.


#### *"Self-Hosted"*

Admittedly, it's not *directly* Linux focused, but it *is* "Linux adjacent". [*Self-Hosted*](https://selfhosted.show/)
is another Jupiter Broadcasting show, but it caters towards (namely) the self-hosting side of the open-source
community. Everything from Nextcloud to Plex, Wireguard to Home Assistant. This is another one of my favorite
podcasts, and thus its placement in my lineup.


#### *"Linux Action News"*

[LAN](https://linuxactionnews.com/), A.K.A. Linux Action News, is a short-and-sweet weekly podcast covering
all the latest news in the Linux world. Whether you're a die-hard Linux fan-boy, or a part-time tech
enthusiast, LAN is a great place to get the latest news in the Linux landscape. Being part of the Jupiter
Broadcasting family, it sees the same level of wonderful production care.


## More?

Hmm... this isn't an all encompassing list, but there just isn't time.... I'll have to write more after a while.
