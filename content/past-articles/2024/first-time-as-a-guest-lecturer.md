Summary: Recently, I was asked to provide a guest lecture. That was a first, for me, and was very fun getting prepared for the lecture. Don't get too excited, it wasn't anything wild, but it was a lot of fun!

I was asked to come and provide a guest lecture regarding 4-H and technology. After all, 4-H is not just "Cows and Cookies." Or, as some of the folks
at the recent National Collegiate 4-H conference in Bozeman, Montana put it: "not just sows, cows, and plows" which I happen to like better with the
reference to pigs.

Either way, I wanted to share my presentation here on the blog, too. So here ya go!

I presented this slideshow along with a discussion-style lecture at the University of Idaho for their Ag Education/Communications course
all about extension. With 4-H being administered by Extension through the [Land Grant University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-grant_university)
system across the United States, it was a great junction!
