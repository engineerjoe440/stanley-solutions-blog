Summary: Some songs have a hidden meaning, and one song that I really enjoy has something hidden so deeply, I just love it!

I'm a fan of many music genres, but I most certainly grew up on country. I mean... Have you met me? I wear a cowboy hat,
for pete-sake! I really lots of music, but I'll always have a soft spot for a good country love song.

This definitely diverges from the other content that I often write about, but I think it's relevant. You see, one of the
modern country groups who I really enjoy is ["LANCO"](https://www.lancomusic.com/); they're more on the soulful side of
country, and their bluesy style is one that I really enjoy. Specifically, I wanted to write about one of their songs
called "Born to Love You", it's a great love song, and I want to highlight one specific piece...

In the second stanza, they sing of:

> Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meanin' of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you

At least... According to Google...

Notice that in the third line of that stanza, the words "in verse 2" are separated. But if you listen to the song, I think
that they're *not* actually separate, at all! Instead, I think the line is a little closer to "inverse-two".

So what the H-E-double-hockey-sticks is an "inverse-two" and why is it in a love song?

Remember back in high-school math class, how we learned about number's inverses? An *inverse* of a number is 1-over-that
number. In other words, a number's inverse is its fraction if you simply placed it as the denominator with 1 as the
numerator. To give a more concrete example, inverse-three is: $\frac{1}{3}$. Likewise, inverse-two is $\frac{1}{2}$.

That's right, inverse-two is "one-half"... Read that stanza again.

Suddenly, it's a little more touching, isn't it? Now whether that's truly LANCO's intention, or not, I think it adds a
whole new meaning and level of sincerity to that song. [**Go have a listen for yourself!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjkn7orWpeA)
