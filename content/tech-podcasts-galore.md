Summary: Everyone's got their new favorite podcast these days. So here, let me list all of my favorites!


I've been asked a lot lately what tech podcasts I listen to, so I thought I'd briefly summarize them all
right here!

Where should I even begin, though? Perhaps I'll start with the security side of computers...

## "Darknet Diaries"

One of my favorites was recommended to me by a colleague. [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)
is an excellent podcast covering everything in the darker side of the internet. No, don't worry... You
don't need to download a TOR browser to listen. This podcast covers everything from hackers to penetration
testers; everything in the cybersecurity space.
