Summary: Holy cow... did somebody order a whole bunch of 4-H activities? Oh... I think that might've been me.

Maybe I should back up a bit, here...

I can start by explaining all of the fun and interesting things that I've done with 4-H over the past few months. I think I'll rewind to about June of last year...

> (more than just a *few* months? oh well...)

### Back in June, we had a bunch of things goin' on...

Now we're all caught up, let me share with you the plans for the new year...

---

We just got back from a teen planning meeting for youth to organize two of the major 4-H conferences in the state, STAC and I-LEADS. (You can go listen to some interviews on
the Idaho 4-H Roundup podcast: https://idaho4hroundup.com/episodes/recorded-live-at-the-2024-steering-committee-meeting/)

<img src="{attach}/images/youth-video-production-2024.png" width="30%" align="right" alt="Youth Producing Videos">

I'm still working with a few youth to finish up recordings for a statewide presentation contest organized by the Idaho Pork Producers Association, and that's going quite well.
It's been great to get some of the youth involved in recording videos and editing their work.

I'm now gearing up to help educate youth at the multi-county Swine Field Day coming up in March. There, I'll be educating youth about ear-notching, and I've got a pretty fun
activity planned. I'll be sure to take pictures and share what I'm doing.

I'm also working on some more electronics dissection workshops with youth in Latah County. Hope to have that program going in mid March! (YAY!) Plus... I've got youth engaged
with me for planning it.

Lastly, I'm also working on what I think will be a fun program for the swine project in my club... "Pig Papers Please" where youth will learn and better understand the
importance of having the correct documentation for crossing state lines with their livestock.

And so many more leadership opportunities with youth...

> This is shaping up to be a fun year in 4-H!
