Summary: Holy cow... did somebody order a whole bunch of 4-H activities? Oh... I think that might've been me.

Maybe I should back up a bit, here...

I can start by explaining all of the fun and interesting things that I've done with 4-H over the past few months. I think I'll rewind to about June of last year...

> (more than just a *few* months? oh well...)

### Back in June, we had a bunch of things goin' on...

- I helped with a fun video for our teen association district representative's campaign video: [Watch Kale's Video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/ekmfGRu4-rY?si=lGsrvIvp0gkvf4qx)
- I helped plan and organize STAC, the State Teen Association Convention (see image at right)

### In July...

- I helped chaperone not just one, but *TWO* 4-H camps, the CL2NI 4-H camp held at Tensed, and the Kootenai County 4-H STEM camp
  > side note, that Kootenai county 4-H camp had some super cool underwater drones that the kids (and some adults) played around with... AWESOME! [[go look, yourself!]](https://immich.stanleysolutionsnw.com/share/cLxmInmj3lQZgnbGLg-hw8sP3wJE-m2Bp59NQNYmv3-B1ApO77oD_V5eiC224uyDgQA)

### In August...

- I joined the fine folks in Gem-Boise county to help judge for their herdsman award (animal care, clenliness, upkeep, etc.)
- I visited some youth and represented the Idaho 4-H Volunteer Association at the Bonneville county fair (namely, some of the youth who are helping with [BetterPix](https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/idaho4h/4HPhotoUploader))
- I helped set up and run the camera system for the Kootenai County 4-H youth livestock auction [[go look, yourself!]](https://immich.stanleysolutionsnw.com/share/9gqF0E8WNQwSDywzREshncvK6cd1cNr85u87DdJGco5VqTAZEBzPlO_yJ6N9amBgYbk)
- I made it over to DJ for Idaho County 4-H at their fair!

- The Latah County Fair was a blast! [[go look, yourself!]](https://immich.stanleysolutionsnw.com/share/w7XmzFmO1k-OVr6GAOGYnP3C5hvV4X0s3y1C6Y-oggy6wsD7-0MhbdJqLmxTT78OIhs)
- I also made it over to the Lewis County fair to visit with the staff, and help out (where I could)
