Summary: Admit it, you've always wanted an overly-complex coffee-making machine, haven't you? Something that's innately simple to use, but a complex masterpiece to marvel at; especially on those early Saturday mornings when the caffeine hasn't kicked in yet. Well, I've done it. I've built just that. I call it... the 5282. Let me explain.

This little endeavor started as a joke. No kidding. I'm not going to tell the whole story here, but if you ask nicely enough, I might tell you in person.
If you know, you know...

I wanted to make a single-cup coffee maker that runs off of an [SEL-2411](https://selinc.com/products/2411). The SEL-2411 can use digital or analog inputs to
interpret the various sensors, and it has a variety of output mechanisms which may be used to do all sorts of fun things with controlling the coffee-maker.
