Summary: Idaho 4-H youth are astounding, aren't they? The things they'll do, the accomplishments they'll achieve. The distances they'll go. It's just awesome. These future leaders can do some amazing things. This last weekend at KYG is a perfect example of it. Read on to see more about how the Video Editor did an incredible job producing some great content.

The [Know Your Government](https://www.uidaho.edu/extension/4h/events/kyg) conference is a tremendous event, one of the
premiere 4-H teen programs held across the state. It's open to 8th, 9th, and 10th grade students across the state. Located
in the state capitol city, Boise, the conference helps youth experience Legislative and Judicial branches of state government.

Each year, a group of students who have already participated in the conference for two years may apply for a third year at the
conference, where they will actually participate in organizing and creating the conference for the next group of 4-H'ers. These
youth are members of the steering committee, and they are all strong leaders. In addition to the few dozen third-year members,
there are four 4th-year members. These remaining four members are:

* Speaker of the House
* Chief Justice
* News Editor
* Video Editor

This year, the video editor -a terrific young leader- produced some wonderful content with several of the other reporter-team
members. Among these was an interview with the Keynote (special guest) speaker, a full recording of the special presentation by
the special guest presenter, and ultimately a marvelous end-of-conference slideshow showcasing the efforts of all the youth
present at the conference.

It's wonderful getting to watch these youth take charge of their activities, and really find their spark in their activities
at the conference. These youth are *hard workers* and they demonstrate responsibility, creativity, and vision. I hope you
can enjoy the little sampling of these great pieces of work that I've collected here. Enjoy!
