Summary: Model railroading has always played close to new technology. I mean, after all Lionel used an electric motor back when they were still relatively new to make the first electric toy train. I'm continuing in that tradition, but doing it at my own speed, making an electric toy train speed-control that I can control from the palm of my hand. That's right, from my phone!
