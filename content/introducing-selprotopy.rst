SEL Protocol is finally coming for Python. That's right, you've heard correctly; it's coming.

But, what is SEL Protocol anyway?

Well, it's a communications protocol, or standard, that was developed by `SEL`_ to support
fast data communications between protective electric relays (the devices that monitor the
power grid for faults) and communications processors. It was developed in the early '90s to
help improve communication support of devices to allow users to monitor protective relays
from a distance, and to perform control operations without being present.

Anyway...

I've begun writing `selprotopy`_ which will be a protocol driver supporting SEL protocol in
Python. This means that users will be able to integrate solutions with SEL relays using
Python!

Obviously, there's a lot to come, so this is not much more than an early announcement.
