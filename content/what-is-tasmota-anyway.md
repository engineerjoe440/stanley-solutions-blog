Summary: I've had a handfull of friends and colleagues ask about Tasmota; what it is, what it does, how to use it, etc. So I thought I'd put together a little article to tell you about this AWESOME open-source IoT firmware, why I use it, and how you can get started with it too!


...intro...

## What is Tasmota?
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/) is an open-source firmware, developed for the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers manufactured by Espressif. It's a lightweight, multifunctional, and
fully featured smart-home software for nearly every IoT device you can think of. It supports both MQTT and RESTful API communications, meaning that it can tie into nearly every home automation system available today.

In particular, there's a few things that I really like about the project.

#### 1) Its Openness
It's absolutely fantastic to have such a wonderful, well developed project all floating out in the open.

#### 2) Its Feature Set

#### 3) Its Lack of Cloud Dependence

## Why a Custom, Generic PCB, Anyway?
