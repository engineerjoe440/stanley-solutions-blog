Summary: It's spring; time for spring cleaning, right? Well, that's even more true if you've got half a dozen servers all floating around, waiting to be used. So I think it's about time that I get some of my new servers mounted in the basement to improve the general usage of my resources!

Alright, I really don't have much to say about this one, other than I've got some new servers mounted in the basement!

I picked up some new server hardware including a really nice Synology NAS, and a 2-U 64-bit computer (yeah, I get excited about that since, remember,
most of my computing hardware is ancient 32-bit stuff). I'm really excited to start setting them up as the new home for my Nextcloud service, and a nice
backup file storage server to start sharing the load of all my git backups, etc. to some rugged machinery.

Anyway... check it all out!!!

### Update:

I've got even more computers now! Take a look!

They're working to host Nextcloud, Gitea, Prometheus, Rainloop, Grafana, and more!
