Summary: Over the last two years, I've become more involved as a project sponsor for some University of Idaho Engineering Capstone projects, and I'm very excited about their growth. Progress may be slow, but it's incremental, and we're approaching goals, which is always exciting!

### Quick! Recap what's being researched...

This year, I'm very thankful that I've been able to sponsor two different projects. A continuation project from
last year's [wildfire detection project](https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/hearing-fires-while-seeing-smoke.html)
and a continuation of my own Capstone project, a [biochar reactor](http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Biochar_Production_System).



# Wildfire Detector (Team FireSense)

I've already talked a lot about this project, so I'm not going to do that here. If you'd like to read up on it more, feel free to check out some of the links
above to the articles I've written previously. Otherwise, check out this year's team poster!

# Biochar Reactor (Team Biochargers)

I've talked less about this project here in my blog... but there's still quite a bit of information that I've written about it. So...

Yeah.. anyway, feel free to leave a comment if you have questions!
