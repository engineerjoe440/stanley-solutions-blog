Summary: Over the last two years, I've become more involved as a project sponsor for some University of Idaho Engineering Capstone projects, and I'm very excited about their growth. Progress may be slow, but it's incremental, and we're approaching goals, which is always exciting!

### Quick! Recap what's being researched...

This year, I'm very thankful that I've been able to sponsor two different projects. A continuation project from
last year's [wildfire detection project](https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/hearing-fires-while-seeing-smoke.html)
and a continuation of my own Capstone project, a [biochar reactor](http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Biochar_Production_System).
