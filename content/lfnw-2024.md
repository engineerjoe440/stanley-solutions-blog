Summary: This is it... My first non-work-related technical presentation at a conference. It's pretty exciting! It's right in my own back yard, even! I'm presenting at LinuxFest Northwest, 2024!

That's right... this is the big-times! Hah!

I'm very excited to be presenting, this year, at LinuxFest Northwest 2024. This will be the first conference where I present as an individual, and not for work. I'm pretty
excited about that. I think it will be a good experience. Unfortunately, I won't have the option to attend in person, since I will simultaneously be helping facilitate for
a teen camp-counselor training in Rathdrum, this weekend. Oh, and did I mention I'm also releasing a podcast episode, too?

Yeah... busy weekend.
