:summary: Making images and plotting might just be possible in real-time-controllers.

I was introduced to a very nice gentleman about a year ago who was demonstrating some
logic that created a .PNG file to demonstrate fault currents easily, and could be
attached in-line as part of an email body. What was so interesting to me is that this
all part of some logic that originated on an `SEL RTAC`_ using some of the functionality
in one of the many IEC 61131-3 libraries that are maintained by myself and the other
developers in the Automation Controllers Group.

.. _SEL RTAC: https://selinc.com/products/3530/
.. _COMTRADE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comtrade#:~:text=COMTRADE%20(Common%20format%20for%20Transient,to%20transient%20power%20system%20disturbances.

Now, the trouble with what this gentleman shared with me, is the reliance on an external
server to process the .CEV and `COMTRADE`_ files generated by monitored protective relays.
That was all well and good, but I still wasn't quite satisfied since there was a certain
amount of reliance on some other device. I wanted something better.

I've recently completed some research where I've been able to effectively create a simple
RGB image in the Bitmap format (.BMP file) so that it can be used and interpreted by most
any computer available today. And should certainly allow for direct inclusion in emails.

Ultimately, this means that there's a good chance that technicians could effectively see
the report of an event without any advanced software, simply by opening their email client
on their smart phone. Talk about convenience. I've been doing some development and testing
and I found great value in this article from technical-recipes.com:

I hope that I'll be sharing more as I fully flesh out some design where I can effectively
create plots in a byte-array that can be stored as an image.
