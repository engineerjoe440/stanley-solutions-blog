Summary: Well. It was here, and now it's gone. The Idaho State Teen Association Convention, or STAC - as we fondly call it, has come and gone. It was a great week of little sleep, much excitement, and lots of smiles; but what's more, is that we had some technology wins and losses to talk about. Thank you, Python!

I don't like making "a big deal of myself" or patting myself on the back, but I have to say, I'm very proud of my little team's accomplishments
with this project for our Idaho State 4-H youth conference. Sure; not everything worked perfectly. Not everything was exactly what we wanted.
But that's just how some of these things go, and overall, it was a phenominal success.

If you're not sure what I'm talking about, let me point you at some of the other blogposts I've written on the subject...

# Our Wins

Yeah! We did have some big wins this year. First and foremost was that we had a great conference. The youth all really seemed to enjoy themselves,
and minor challenges and hiccups aside, all things were good.

You know, we even had more delegates than usual! Idaho invited Washington State to bring a small delegation of youth who are going to be involved
in planning their own STAC-equivalent in Washington, next year. Pretty cool, huh?

Whats more, we had a successful first run of our Photo Uploader Site. Hmm... I think we still need a better name, don't we? Thoughts, anyone?
Leave them in the comments. The site didn't crash, it didn't buckle, it didn't lose anything (that I didn't accidentally delete). And it didn't
go haywire in some other way.

In total, we had more than 1200 photos uploaded to [`albums.idaho4h.com`](https://albums.idaho4h.com/). Yeah, that's right. More than 1200 in
less than 4 days. Whoop, whoop! Now, in reality, there's nothing terribly impressive about this. That's not really *that many* pictures in today's
world, but for an app built on weekends by two people who were both learning all the way through, it's a big win!

> Ok. Let me toot my own horn, one more time.

Our biggest win, is that *we* built this thing. I worked with a youth member who's involved (and super-clever, might I add) in some of these state
events, and together we created this tool to help all of the adults, and all of his peers to engage in a pleasant and simpler way. If you ask me,
*THAT* is the biggest win. We've definatively proven that the youth are more than capable of building their own infrastructure with guidance; and,
after all, that's what 4-H is all about. The whole ethos really is *"learn by doing."*

# Where's the Proof?

Oh! You want to see the uploader? The album-site? The photos? OK!

You can go browse all of the source code that our team (one of the Steering Committee youth members and myself) created, or you can go look at the
finished product (the uploader), and even take a look at the album site. The album site has a single public album where all of the photos have
been moved after they've been filtered and cleaned.

Ah! But before you ask; yes, that filtering and cleaning *is* a manual process. Someone has to go through all of them and look for anything that
shouldn't be made public before the photos become viewable. And that sorta takes us into the next topic...

# Our Losses

As much as I would *LOVE* to say that we had zero issues this year with our new tool, that just isn't the truth. We had some great failures, too.
I mean, after all, just look at that guy on the right. Would you trust him to make something that didn't have at least one or two hiccups? Me neither.

So here are all the little things that went wrong...
