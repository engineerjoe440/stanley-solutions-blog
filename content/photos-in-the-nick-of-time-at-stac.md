Summary: Well. It was here, and now it's gone. The Idaho State Teen Association Convention, or STAC - as we fondly call it, has come and gone. It was a great week of little sleep, much excitement, and lots of smiles; but what's more, is that we had some technology wins and losses to talk about. Thank you, Python!

I don't like making "a big deal of myself" or patting myself on the back, but I have to say, I'm very proud of my little team's accomplishments
with this project for our Idaho State 4-H youth conference. Sure; not everything worked perfectly. Not everything was exactly what we wanted.
But that's just how some of these things go, and overall, it was a phenominal success.

If you're not sure what I'm talking about, let me point you at some of the other blogposts I've written on the subject...

# Our Wins

Yeah! We did have some big wins this year. First and foremost was that we had a great conference. The youth all really seemed to enjoy themselves,
and minor challenges and hiccups aside, all things were good.

Whats more, we had a successful first run of our Photo Uploader Site. Hmm... I think we still need a better name, don't we? Thoughts, anyone?
Leave them in the comments. The site didn't crash, it didn't buckle, it didn't lose anything (that I didn't accidentally delete). And it didn't
go haywire in some other way.

In total, we had more than 1200 photos uploaded to [`albums.idaho4h.com`](https://albums.idaho4h.com/). Yeah, that's right. More than 1200 in
less than 4 days. Whoop, whoop! Now, in reality, there's nothing terribly impressive about this. That's not really *that many* pictures in today's
world, but for an app built on weekends by two people who were both learning all the way through, it's a big win!
