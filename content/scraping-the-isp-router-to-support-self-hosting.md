Summary: To host my home services, I need to be able to have a dynamic-DNS, and to do that, I've been using DuckDNS (a great service, by the way), but it's time that I start getting more serious, and remove theCNAME from my domain, and get something a little more proper. But... to do that, I'll need my public IP. Good thing my ISP-provided-router displays that on the front page! Now, it's time for just a little Python...
