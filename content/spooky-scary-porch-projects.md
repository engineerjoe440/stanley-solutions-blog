Summary: It's been a crazy month, but isn't that how Halloween is supposed to be, anyway? Crazy? Well, maybe not like this. Let me explain...

I've been slowly plugging away at some projects around the house.

> emphasis on *slowly*

So, earlier this fall, I picked up a whole bunch of cedar boards to replace the nasty old porch ceiling that I have. If you wanted to see more of what the old
ceiling looked like, go look at my [article discussing the St Helens aftermath...](./mt-st-helens-adventures) All of that led up to a ***BUSY*** weekend putting
the front porch together...

##### See?

But since I was doing all of this work, I wanted to have some cool new lights put in, and I wanted to add some special effects, too; and that required some custom
wiring.

Lastly, I've got to call out the wonderful little box that does so much of the heavy lifting for me... the FireFly Lightning simulator by
[Lights Alive](https://lightsalive.com). I love this little thing, it's so much fun!

All of the controls are now accessible right next to the front door, which is *wonderful!* I'm not going to go into too much detail here. Feel free to leave a
comment if you'd like to know more, but I'll leave you with the video of all the special effects!

## UPDATE:

A colleague shared this, and I thought it was too funny not to share...
