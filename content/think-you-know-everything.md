Summary: A step back down memory-lane, I pulled out the ol' 'Quiz Board' for a presentation!


This is gonna be a quick one, but I just wanted to share some photos of my old high-school
engineering project, the ***"Quiz Board"***. It was a project of mine to make a *cool*
and engaging public education system. I used it at the county fair to help teach folks about
swine, since that was my 4-H project.

Now... I promise, I'll work to add a little more detail about the technical aspects. After all,
this whole system ran around a 3-bit processor.
