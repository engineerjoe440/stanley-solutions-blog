    <p>Alright, I really don't have much to say about this one, other than I've got some new servers mounted in the basement!</p>
<p>I picked up some new server hardware including a really nice Synology NAS, and a 2-U 64-bit computer (yeah, I get excited about that since, remember,
most of my computing hardware is ancient 32-bit stuff). I'm really excited to start setting them up as the new home for my Nextcloud service, and a nice
backup file storage server to start sharing the load of all my git backups, etc. to some rugged machinery.</p>
<p>Anyway... check it all out!!!</p>
<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>I've got even more computers now! Take a look!</p>
<p>They're working to host Nextcloud, Gitea, Prometheus, Rainloop, Grafana, and more!</p>
