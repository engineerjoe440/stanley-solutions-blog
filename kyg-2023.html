<p>I just wanted to leave a few of the pictures I had taken of me during STAC this year. We had an absolute blast in Boise this President's Day weekend. Idaho 4-H delegates
from around the state in 8th and 9th grades toured the capitol, the Idaho supreme court, and other parts of Boise. They learned about the legislative and judicial branches
of Idaho state government, and they even met with the Governor of Idaho!</p>
<p>I always come away from these events realizing just how fortunate I am to get to work with some truly wonderful people, supporting such a fun and exciting program.
Participating in 4-H is a true privilege, and it's just so much fun to hang out with all those brilliant young leaders. Seeing them grow and mature is so much fun!</p>
<p>Something else that really made me happy is that this year I was able to see some young 4-H'ers from Clearwater county (where I grew up) get involved in the leadership
teams organizing the event. How cool is that?! It's come a long way since when I grew up in Clearwater county, and it's exciting to see some new faces getting involved.
In fact, I think it's been nearly a decade since someone from Clearwater county was involved at this level! How cool is that?</p>

<p>Not only are there really cool youth participants, the chaperones and adults make these events so much fun. I'm reminded just how much fun it is to get to hang around
other adults that like indulging in some of the more fun parts of youth events. Being silly with the delegates, having a good time, and still carrying ourselves with
dignity. Clearly I'm still "riding the high" of the event!</p>
<p>If you ever get the chance to send your youth to KYG, or go yourself... <strong><em>DO IT!</em></strong></p>
