Summary: So if you're gonna use Python to help bring photos from youth together; how, exactly, do you do it? This article will look at how we're using Lychee, Python, FastAPI, and React.js to make an ultra-simple, highly effective photo upload service for a youth conference.

If you've been keeping tabs on what I've been up to lately, you might know that I've been slowly getting back into 4-H
involvement. Namely, I'm now a certified volunteer in Idaho, and I'm starting to dip my toes into leading projects.

Recently, I shared [how I'm working with youth to create an app in Python and React.js](/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html)
and how I'm excited to be working *with* some of the youth to develop the app. We're working to use some of the "latest and
greatest" technology to ensure that the service is not only forward-looking, but helps to teach forward-looking practices.

In this article though, I want to talk a bit more about the technical details about what we're doing, and how it's working.
