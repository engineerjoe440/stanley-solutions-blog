    <p>You know, I never thought I'd spend so much time in my arm-chair. But here we are.</p>
<p>It's become pretty comfortable, recently, with all the new audio networking I've been working on (namely my audio network using VBAN - you can read
more about that <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/spam-the-vban-for-non-stop-audio.html">here</a>). Still, I'm not about to just sit back and listen
without doing <em>something</em>. I mean, c'mon! I'm an insatiable tinkerer, after all. So, I spend a lot of time working away on my laptop (really starting
to love <a class="reference external" href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">KDE Plasma!</a>) and poking around at random bits and bytes.</p>
<p>So I need a charger, but I get bored dragging around that plain ole' wall-wart! So I thought I could do one better. I've seen plenty of those neat
looking amo-can stereos, online, but that's not quite my style. If you know me, you know I prefer cabinet stereos. No, instead I thought I could put
all of my power supply components in the can; and throw in a few of my own touches along the way. So, I decided I'd get to work.</p>
<p>A little too much drooling and visitation of our favorite, least-favorite A-to-Z online marketplace, I had an assortment of nerdy-looking switch
assemblies, voltage meters, and a beefy little multi-output DC power supply.</p>

<p>Now with all these neat little switches, I've got to do <strong>*something*</strong> with them, right?</p>
<p>You bet!</p>
<p>How about adding a little Linux computer, to the mix? Sure! I gave yet another old machine new life by taking an old
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.embeddedarm.com/">Technologic computer</a> and lobbing it into the case; mounted with Ethernet, serial terminal, and dual USB ports exposed
for easy access. My own sort of computer tower, you might say.</p>
<img alt="Mounted a Linux computer in there too!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203630587_497812148003314_6021780960392169872_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>But this thing's ultimately a power supply, right? So it's got to have <em>power</em>! And that, it does! Inside, I've mounted a little multi-output power supply
with 3 discrete taps; 24V, 12V, and 5V. I don't quite know what I'm going to do with 24V, yet, but the 5V and 12V are already serving my purposes to power
the little computer, a variety of lights, and perhaps a few more odds and ends as time progresses.</p>
<img alt="The power!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203150896_2002088606597054_7741904286201403555_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>What's more, however, is that I've also inserted several USB power hubs, and mounted a computer charger inside the can so that I can power my laptop, too!
In fact, as I sit her writing, I'm using the power supply right now!</p>
<p>Now, I'll grant that like so many of my little tinkering projects, this one is nowhere near being complete, but I will say that <em>one</em> of the switches
does function to control the two voltage meters mounted inside (one analog, the other digital).</p>
<img alt="The final (but not finished) product!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/202866327_175178427900304_1831963921642931273_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" />

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Another quick note about the project, I finally got to use my brand-new drill press for it! Woo-hoo!!! That was a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Hopefully, when I get the little computer tied into some more important things, I'll have more to say on the matter, but first, I've
got to get it booting Debian... Then see if I can possibly get it to run newer images... Like, I dunno, something <em>NEW</em>?!?!</p>
