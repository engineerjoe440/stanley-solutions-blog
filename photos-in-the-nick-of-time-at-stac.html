      <p>I don't like making "a big deal of myself" or patting myself on the back, but I have to say, I'm very proud of my little team's accomplishments
with this project for our Idaho State 4-H youth conference. Sure; not everything worked perfectly. Not everything was exactly what we wanted.
But that's just how some of these things go, and overall, it was a phenominal success.</p>
<p>If you're not sure what I'm talking about, let me point you at some of the other blogposts I've written on the subject...</p>

<h1>Our Wins</h1>
<p><img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/stac-2022/FBAC19F1-F146-4038-BCFF-0D7CF2C3CCD5.jpeg" style="width: 30%" align="right" alt="Go Team!"></p>
<p>Yeah! We did have some big wins this year. First and foremost was that we had a great conference. The youth all really seemed to enjoy themselves,
and minor challenges and hiccups aside, all things were good.</p>
<p>You know, we even had more delegates than usual! Idaho invited Washington State to bring a small delegation of youth who are going to be involved
in planning their own STAC-equivalent in Washington, next year. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p>Whats more, we had a successful first run of our Photo Uploader Site. Hmm... I think we still need a better name, don't we? Thoughts, anyone?
Leave them in the comments. The site didn't crash, it didn't buckle, it didn't lose anything (that I didn't accidentally delete). And it didn't
go haywire in some other way.</p>
<p>In total, we had more than 1200 photos uploaded to <a href="https://albums.idaho4h.com/"><code>albums.idaho4h.com</code></a>. Yeah, that's right. More than 1200 in
less than 4 days. Whoop, whoop! Now, in reality, there's nothing terribly impressive about this. That's not really <em>that many</em> pictures in today's
world, but for an app built on weekends by two people who were both learning all the way through, it's a big win!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok. Let me toot my own horn, one more time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our biggest win, is that <em>we</em> built this thing. I worked with a youth member who's involved (and super-clever, might I add) in some of these state
events, and together we created this tool to help all of the adults, and all of his peers to engage in a pleasant and simpler way. If you ask me,
<em>THAT</em> is the biggest win. We've definatively proven that the youth are more than capable of building their own infrastructure with guidance; and,
after all, that's what 4-H is all about. The whole ethos really is <em>"learn by doing."</em></p>
<h1>Where's the Proof?</h1>
<p><img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/stac-2022/20220619_172613.jpg" style="width: 40%" align="left" alt="Where is it all?"></p>
<p>Oh! You want to see the uploader? The album-site? The photos? OK!</p>

<p>You can go browse all of the source code that our team (one of the Steering Committee youth members and myself) created, or you can go look at the
finished product (the uploader), and even take a look at the album site. The album site has a single public album where all of the photos have
been moved after they've been filtered and cleaned.</p>
<p>Ah! But before you ask; yes, that filtering and cleaning <em>is</em> a manual process. Someone has to go through all of them and look for anything that
shouldn't be made public before the photos become viewable. And that sorta takes us into the next topic...</p>
<h1>Our Losses</h1>
<p><img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/stac-2022/DSC_0630.JPG" style="width: 30%" align="right" alt="This clown..."></p>
<p>As much as I would <em>LOVE</em> to say that we had zero issues this year with our new tool, that just isn't the truth. We had some great failures, too.
I mean, after all, just look at that guy on the right. Would you trust him to make something that didn't have at least one or two hiccups? Me neither.</p>
<p>So here are all the little things that went wrong...</p>
<h4>1) Not all Districts Were Accounted For</h4>
<p>Ok. Admittedly, this isn't exactly a failure, but I wanted to call it out, anyway, since there was some work to be done here, and it emphasized a
point of contention in our system. You see, we've got a hard-coded mechanism for managing district validation for the district selection. That selection
is this little section here...</p>
<p><img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/district-selection.png" style="width: 40%" align="center" alt="District Selection"></p>
<p>In the code snippet below, you can see that there's a hard-coded number of options that are validated against. This isn't the only place though, the
React.js frontend also has these values hard-coded. SO... We'll need to determine a way to make those selections more discrete, and customizable. Hmm...</p>

<p>Ultimately, this came up last minute (Sunday night before the delegation arrived) when we were discussing the Washington-State delegation's participation
in the district competitions. Since they would be participating, we'd need them added to the list. Thankfully, due to our automated build system (thank
goodness I spent the time to get that thing working), I was able to make the code changes, verify that my changes had some bugs, fix the bugs, and deploy
- all within the time of about a half-an-hour.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'll call it a loss, but there was a hidden win, too!</p>
<h4>2) Limited Number of Photos in an Upload Group</h4>
<p>We've all heard that joke about assumptions, right?</p>
<p>You know, the one that says something about making an a$$ out of you and me? That one... Well, is it not the case that in engineering, we have to make a
LOT of assumptions? Oh yeah. We do.</p>
<p>Well, we made an assumption about how many pictures people would want to upload at any given time. Guess we got those numbers a little wrong. We quickly
learned that people wanted to upload a lot more than 10 pictures at any given time. Dang. Good thing GitLab has bug-tracking! So I went ahead and logged
it already: https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/idaho4h/4HPhotoUploader/-/issues/48  -- Love GitLab.</p>
<h4>3) Limited Download Access</h4>
<p><img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/stac-2022/20220619_172534.jpg" style="width: 40%" align="left" alt="Not Enough Access."></p>
<p>Unfortunately, another thing that we learned the hard way this year was that downloading an entire album as a zipped file isn't as easy when you're not
the web-admin (<em>coughs</em> that's me).</p>
