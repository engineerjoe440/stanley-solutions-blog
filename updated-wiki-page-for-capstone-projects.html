    <p>Yes, I've written a bunch of blogposts about the Engineering Capstone project work that students have been conducting at the University of Idaho. If you don't
believe me, or you've forgotten, go take a look at the <a href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/category/capstone.html">summary of posts</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot of really cool things that they've done in the past, but I've not done the best keeping up with it all and putting it in one <em>central</em> place so that
folks can just find the stuff they're interested in. Well, I've finally gotten around to updating my <a href="https://js.wiki/">Wiki.js</a> instance to have some nice pages
about all that information.</p>

<p>More than anything, it's a "landing place" for most of the other information that's already been culminated. Regardless, it's a nice face-lift!</p>
