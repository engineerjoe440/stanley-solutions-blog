  <meta name="description" content="I recently attended the 2022 University of Idaho, Washington State University joint Youth Swine Field day in Asotin, WA. It's been a while since I've been very involved in swine projects in 4-H, but it's been good getting back into the swing of things. Admmittedly, I'm learning new things all the time, myself, but since the ethos of 4-H is "Learn by Doing," I'm always one for good, tangible, hands-on exercises to help engage youth while teaching. I thought it about time that I share a few of my ideas!">

      <p>I'm just getting back into the swing of 4-H activities. Monthly community meetings, regular project meetings, etc. But I want to bring some exciting new
learning activities to the projects I'm supporting.</p>
<p>I spent... gosh... 10(?) years in the swine project, about 8 of which were both in market and breeding projects, so quite a bit of time around those pigs!
Well worth it, if you ask me.</p>
<p>As I'm getting started with leading, I've been starting to amass some of the ideas I've had for learning exercise. Some are borrowed, and some are of my
own creation. This article will chronicle some of those ideas; both the good, and the... interesting.</p>
<h2>“Bad Water”</h2>
<p>Ok, I can't claim that this was my idea (thanks, Roxanne!); but I'll shamelessly use it, because... <strong><em>Wow!</em></strong></p>
<p>Clean water is essential! Most of us know this, and some of us have first-hand experience with the alternatives and their repercussions, but it's very
important to instill this <em>need</em> in youth who are raising livestock (not just pigs). I think most of the reasons are pretty self-expanitory, but I'll
list some of them, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Hogs who don't have access to clean water...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>...are often unhealthy, prone to disease; if not because of pathogens in the water, because of lack of hydration.</li>
<li>...rarely gain weight optimally. Their bodies are too preoccupied with surviving to pack on muscle the way we want them to.</li>
<li>...can become aggressive over clean water, or become lethargic, not getting the exercise they need.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the exercise that Roxanne so graciously provided me brings together Sprite, and soda-water. One is pretty universally enjoyed by young people, the
other almost the opposite. Fill so many cups that each 4-H'er can have a cup to themselves, splitting the pour right down the middle. Half the cups get
Sprite, the other half get soda-water. Be sure not to over-fill the cups so that the kiddos will need to pee too quickly. Tell all of the kids that you've
got some "soda" that they can drink, but don't tell them that some are better than the others. Let them all take a cup and have a drink. After you get the
usual "grumblings" and complaints, offer the kids more if they'd like it.</p>
<p>At this point, the kids who had Sprite will likely get more, the others may, or may not. It's probably a good time to ask the kids who <em>clearly</em> didn't
like their drinks what they didn't like about it. This all, of course, leads right in to a perfect opportunity for you to talk about the importance of
fresh, clean clean water, and how having anything other than good clean water will likely make pigs less likely to drink anything.</p>
<p>Pretty fun, huh?</p>
<h2>“Withdrawl Period”</h2>
<p>So, admittedly, this one's still in the incubator... gonna have to work on the scheme a little more still before it's where I want it. But here's the
general idea:</p>
<p>Most, if not all, livestock medications have what's known as a "withdrawl period;" a length of time after which the animal should not be harvested for
risk of the medication still being present in their system and likely in their meat. In general, it's considered <em>unwise</em> to eat meat which still has
any measurable level of medicine. This is important for 4-H youth to understand, because they're responsible for the care of their animal right up to its
harvest, which means that if they were to administer medicine to the animal within the withdrawl period, they could be contaminating the animal's meat.</p>
<p>The withdrawl period is brought up a few times throughout the year, and my idea is to show the kiddos how to experience it, first-hand.</p>
<p>Like I said... still needs some work, but the idea basically surrounds Asparagus. Yep, that's right. You might already be two steps ahead of me here, but
if you're not quite with me yet, let me remind you of that one-so-ever-fascinating-trait of Asparagus; after you eat enough of it, when you pee, you can smell it!</p>
<p>Yep. I went there.</p>
<p>But remember, we're dealing with kids, here! That stuff is funny, and it can have a big impact! Imagine being a kid and having somme kind of Asparagus-based treat one day when you hear about "Withdral Periods," and then remembering it when you go to pee the next! Talk about a first-hand lesson!</p>
