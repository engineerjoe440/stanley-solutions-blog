    <p>In a <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/networked-audio-using-vban-and-rpi.html">recent article</a> I wrote about how I'd started to integrate more of my house's
audio system with a networked audio protocol known as &quot;VBAN&quot;. I'd gotten some great
use out of the system, but I'd started running into some problems more recently...</p>
<p>You see, for some reason, if I were streaming some audio to my Raspberry Pi, and the
stream dropped into a lull (i.e. between songs, say) I'd often see some pretty nasty
buffer errors from Alsa. Now, I could've dug into it much deeper and tried to get to
the root of the problem in <cite>C</cite>, but I didn't really feel like it. Instead, I thought
I'd just throw some Python at it! So after spending an intermittent afternoon
reminding myself how the <cite>subprocess</cite> module works, and debugging my own madness, I
got a working script that I use as a <em>systemd</em> service.</p>

<p>With that magic little Python script, I basically kick VBAN in the butt every time
that Alsa decides to be unfriendly (which happens quite regularly) by killing the
process, and then starting it right back up. With the magic of computers, this
happens very fast, and as I'd briefly mentioned earlier, it only seems to really
play into the &quot;mix&quot; in-between songs anyway. So after building the script, giving
it a nice little test drive, and scrutinizing my Raspberry Pi; I thought it was
time to build it back into my simple little service.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'll be back to crack the hood back open on this one at some point, but
for now, I'm happy to stream my music back to my cabinet stereo with the power of
Linux.</p>
