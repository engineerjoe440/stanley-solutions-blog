    <p>Well, I'm fairly certain that I've discussed this before. But on the off chance I haven't. I like trains.</p>
<p>Yep, I'm one of those guys.</p>
<p>When I was little, I remember spending countless hours with Thomas the Tank Engine playing so many wild adventures. But I also remember playing as many,
if not more, countless hours with my Lionel Toy Trains. Those little electrical wonders. A teensy, tiny little motor, a handful of electric lights, and
a really slick looking little die-cast metal body, and those trains were basically real. it's sort of a Christmas tradition for lots of families to set up
a little Lionel layout around the Christmas tree. Now that I have my own house, it's no different for me! I've got my little loop of track, and my
great-uncle's postwar Lionel Berkshire, all steamed up and ready to entertain!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me. Entertain me. That's about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anywho...</p>
<p>Those Lionel trains are pretty slick with their bells, and whistles, but I thought I'd try something different. There's these new-fangled things called
microcontrollers, and they work really well with this magic called WiFi. Have you heard of it? So I thought I'd give it a whack.</p>

<p>You probably already know that I'm an avid home-automation enthusiast. I host a bunch of my own web-services, and I have my Home Assistant running on an
ancient x86 PC (yeah, you can hear the spinning rust any time I ask it to do something). So I thought it would be neat to take it a step further, and
automate my little toy trains. Mind you, Lionel's already gotten this perfected. They have a <em>way-cool</em> system called TMCC with their "Legacy" remote.
They've even got bluetooth! Wild, huh? Well, that would all be well-and-good, except for the fact that I need to control OLD trains. Remember what I said
earlier?</p>

<p>Yeah. That.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't going to stop me. I thought I'd build my own control. I could get all slick-and-fancy and build some cool digitally-controlled, smart
power-supply; but where's the fun in that? Actually, I just didn't feel like doing the math, required... but maybe another time.</p>
<p>I decided to use one of Lionel's early control mechanisms, a manual rheostat! That's right, they made variable resistors to slow down, or speed up those
old trains. What's advantageous of that old system <em>for me</em>, however, is that it's a linear device. I mean, it moves in a straight line from one extreme,
to the other. That means that I could take it and add some jurry-rigged control systems. Namely, a piece of all-thread, and a stepper motor, controlled
by a driver board and an ESP8266.</p>

<h3>Neat, huh?</h3>
<p>So that's one of the things I've been working on, as of late. Working on my own Lionel Toy Train control. I've still got plenty of work to do (isn't that
what I always say, anymore), but it's a start! Just need to do the programming, now, and I think I'll be able to nail that with PlatformIO and some
handy-dandy ESP8266 libraries. Gosh, I love libraries!</p>
