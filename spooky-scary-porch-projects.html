    <p>I've been slowly plugging away at some projects around the house.</p>

<p>So, earlier this fall, I picked up a whole bunch of cedar boards to replace the nasty old porch ceiling that I have. If you wanted to see more of what the old
ceiling looked like, go look at my <a href="./mt-st-helens-adventures">article discussing the St Helens aftermath...</a> All of that led up to a <strong><em>BUSY</em></strong> weekend putting
the front porch together...</p>
<h5>See?</h5>

<p>But since I was doing all of this work, I wanted to have some cool new lights put in, and I wanted to add some special effects, too; and that required some custom
wiring.</p>

<p>Lastly, I've got to call out the wonderful little box that does so much of the heavy lifting for me... the FireFly Lightning simulator by
<a href="https://lightsalive.com">Lights Alive</a>. I love this little thing, it's so much fun!</p>

<p>All of the controls are now accessible right next to the front door, which is <em>wonderful!</em> I'm not going to go into too much detail here. Feel free to leave a
comment if you'd like to know more, but I'll leave you with the video of all the special effects!</p>
