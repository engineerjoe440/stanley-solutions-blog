Well, that's even more true if you've got half a dozen servers all floating around, waiting to be used. So I think it's about time that I get some of my new servers mounted in the basement to improve the general usage of my resources!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alright, I really don't have much to say about this one, other than I've got some new servers mounted in the basement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up some new server hardware including a really nice Synology NAS, and a 2-U 64-bit computer (yeah, I get excited about that since, remember,
most of my computing hardware is ancient 32-bit stuff). I'm really excited to start setting them up as the new home for my Nextcloud service, and a nice
backup file storage server to start sharing the load of all my git backups, etc. to some rugged machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway... check it all out!!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Self-Hosting"></category><category term="Server"></category><category term="Web"></category><category term="Hosting"></category><category term="Self-Hosting"></category><category term="Hardware"></category><category term="Computing"></category></entry></feed>
