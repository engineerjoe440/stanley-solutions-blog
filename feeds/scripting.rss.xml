Tricky to use with other resources. Seems I most frequently run into this issue when working on updating my blog with pictures that I took on my phone. I really would much rather use a &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; format in place of the somewhat irksome &lt;code&gt;.heic&lt;/code&gt; format that my iPhone captures. There's plenty of things online that I could upload my photos too, but who really wants to do that? I'd rather use something a little more "close to home."&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 20:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2024-01-24:/quick-n-simple-photo-converter.html</guid><category>Scripting</category><category>blog</category><category>website</category><category>shell</category><category>script</category><category>heic</category><category>image</category><category>photo</category><category>converter</category><category>conversion</category><category>file</category><category>iphone</category></item></channel></rss>
