Bring on the new sustainability-focused tech!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to get in the habit of writing up some brief articles more regularly to talk about
some of the more interesting articles and news that I've heard recently in the realm of
sustainability. Now, I'll grant, that I typically do my own sort of exploration(s) into
different sustainability projects and research, but I want to keep these articles focused
on what I hear is happening outside of my little pocket on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway... Here's what I've heard about new sustainability topics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recycled-concrete"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recycled Concrete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long has old concrete been a challenge for construction and demolition workers. Long has
the question arisen as: &amp;quot;So, now that we've torn it down; what do we do with it?&amp;quot; Well,
it turns out there might just be a solution! I was introduced to this brief article which
came from a scientific paper describing some research findings. You can look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201130150358.htm"&gt;recycled concrete article&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself. For me, this is most exciting since it
means that &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; amounts of waste concrete can be kept out of the landfill! Not to
mention that fewer resources may need to be used to maintain high-wear concrete surfaces
such as sidewalks for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transistors-detecting-herbicides"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transistors Detecting Herbicides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now this one is really interesting; not that concrete &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; interesting, it's just
that this one seems to fit into my area of expertise a little more (you know, electricity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201201124142.htm"&gt;herbicide sensing transistors&lt;/a&gt; describes a scientific article that details
a new technology that's still being researched that would allow specific transistors to be
immersed in water or wastewater to detect certain levels of herbicides. Why is this
important? Well, research is continuing to show that significant levels of herbicides can
be dangerous to marine life including everything from flora to fauna. Both plants and
animals can suffer from high levels of herbicides. With this emerging tech, we could see
improved water and wastewater management such that industrial facilities and municipalities
may be able to monitor their output, and make more informed decisions to adapt their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it for this go-around, but hopefully I can keep talking about some new
and emerging tech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
