Well, why not? This time, we'll be tackling reading CEV files from SEL in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. That's right. I'm starting another new project. But hey! There's a lot of framework
that needs to be introduced before I can start doing all the cool high-level stuff that we
all want to see and use. I mean, by now you should understand that I'm all about getting
the framework right. If you're still not sure, go read my rant about getting the framework
right... &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/write-framework-once.html"&gt;This is my rant on getting framework right.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goal:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the plan here, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this project, &lt;cite&gt;pycev&lt;/cite&gt; (I've almost considered that it should be pronounced &amp;quot;pie-safe&amp;quot;, but
that's not how it looks, so we'll let that stew a while longer) will be a package for reading and
interpreting SEL Compressed EVent records. They're a proprietary (but open) format in which SEL
protective relays collect event information and &amp;quot;compress&amp;quot; it into a format that's easily read
by machines (computers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's already a handful of projects out in the wild for reading COMTRADE records; which, if
you're unfamiliar are &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Common Format for Transient Data Exchange&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; files, and are supported by
many SEL relays in addition to a much broader number of other vendor devices. Trouble is, not
everyone uses COMTRADE, and comparatively, CEV files are a little simpler, and (in my opinion)
more straight-forward and robust. Perhaps the best Python project for reading COMTRADE files
is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dparrini/python-comtrade"&gt;Python Comtrade&lt;/a&gt;. That project shows great maturity and value. It also sees regular updates
and bugfixes as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's such a well respected and mature project, I'd like to take it as inspiration for
&lt;cite&gt;pycev&lt;/cite&gt; and use it to help me realize the best API for the package so that the two libraries
could (potentially) be used interchangeably for various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-first"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's First?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess starting the package development is first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already carved out a repository, and I've got something of a skeleton package put together.
I think the first step will be getting enough working that I can upload it to PyPI to reserve
the namespace. Then full development will need to come. There's a good handful of things that
need to be tackled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload Project to PyPI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Core Functionality and Match API to that of &amp;quot;Python-Comtrade&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Automated Test Suite with Local Server and Various Existing CEV Files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the sort of roadmap I see before me. Now, the time-frame is still way up in the air;
so who knows whe this all will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; happen. But here's hoping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in checking in on the project, and would like to jump in and contribute,
have a little look at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/pycev"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;, and feel free to open an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/pycev/issues"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; to start a conversation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Now to get the controls working...&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still deep in the process of getting a fully functional SEL protocol binding suite in Python, but,
hey! At least I can write a little update on what's been going on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(if you haven't read my article on what &lt;cite&gt;selprotopy&lt;/cite&gt; is, take a look &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/sel-protocol-coming-to-python.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month of so, I've been able to really &amp;quot;whack out&amp;quot; some reasonable functionality. In
fact, I've been able to poll an SEL-351 for both digital and analog data. For those of you who
are a little familiar with SEL protocol, that means that I've been able to create a parser for
the relay definition block, and the various fast-meter blocks in addition to the DNA definition.
To boot, I've even tested (albeit breifly) on an SEL-751 and saw pretty promissing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all pretty good, but the eventual goal (well, &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; eventual goal) is to be able to poll
regularly and send commands/controls as needed. I'd also like to be able to read CEV reports
(more on that in the future) and perhaps the relay's SER (Sequential Event Recorder). So, is any
of the control functionality working yet? Not really...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten to the point where the commands &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be configured and sent correctly to the
relay, but no dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the lines, I've clearly &amp;quot;bugged&amp;quot; something up. So now, it's really just a matter
of doing some additional debugging. Hmm... will need to get started on that. Trouble is, I've got
lots of other fun projects to work on too!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="c-mon-joe-wrap-this-thing-up"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C'mon, Joe; wrap this thing up...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I'm rambling; at this point, I'm pretty excited to say that I've got some polling working
with &lt;cite&gt;selprotopy&lt;/cite&gt;, but there's clearly some more to work on. I'm hoping that I can get commands
working here pretty soon, and then I've got a handful of options as the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-could"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I could:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a system to read the SER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the CEV reading figured out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start testing on a variety of SEL relays (but this would require testing a FOSS project at SEL,
so I'm still not sure about this one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get an automated test suite built on my local GitLab instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly some more work coming, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SEL Protocol is finally coming for Python. That's right, you've heard correctly; it's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The new... `selprotopy`!" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engineerjoe440/sel-proto-py/master/logo/selprotopy.png" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what is SEL Protocol anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's a communications protocol, or standard, that was developed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://selinc.com/"&gt;SEL&lt;/a&gt; to support
fast data communications between protective electric relays (the devices that monitor the
power grid for faults) and communications processors. It was developed in the early '90s to
help improve communication support of devices to allow users to monitor protective relays
from a distance, and to perform control operations without being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've begun writing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/sel-proto-py"&gt;selprotopy&lt;/a&gt; which will be a protocol driver supporting SEL protocol in
Python. This means that users will be able to integrate solutions with SEL relays using
Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there's a lot to come, so this is not much more than an early announcement.
If you're interested in contributing, feel free to drop me a message! I'd love to interact!&lt;/p&gt;
