What's more, it's not common for people to really understand what parts make up a computer, and how they can be used.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm very happy that I've been able to participate in a new style of workshop with 4-H; dissecting computers -- tearing them apart and learning about
what parts they consist of, how they're put together, and how they might be refurbished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, there's a few things that I'll need to improve for the next cycle of the workshop, but there was a lot of learning, enjoyment, and fun
had by most of the participants. That's right, I said &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. That's because there was some feedback that the exercise was boring, or that
it wasn't really what the youth were interested in doing. Fair is fair! There's always room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://nextcloud.stanleysolutionsnw.com/apps/files_sharing/publicpreview/otMmsgzgyGHAr9j?file=/336518685_235097258964719_2275477676002838990_n.jpg&amp;fileId=13324&amp;x=1920&amp;y=1080&amp;a=true" width="100%" alt="Our Group"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Worked Well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody's got old, half-dead computers. Right? Unless you're a hoarder like me... then you've got LOTS of old, half-dead computers in varying states
of repair (or &lt;em&gt;disrepair&lt;/em&gt;). We were able to secure PLENTY of computers that the youth could tear apart. Several wonderfully gracious community members were able
to provide a collection of great computers for us to tear down. Everything from laptops, to towers, to an all-in-one! I'm an avid believer that this is a win-win
for us and the community. We were able to acquire old computers, ready for destruction; and the community was able to do a little spring-cleaning, getting rid of
some of their clutter. Beyond that, we're able to take those old machines and recycle their waste parts. Very nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to amass a small arsenal of inexpensive SSDs for the activity, which meant when some computer's needed their drives replaced, it was an easy matter.
That also meant that systems could see a nice little upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also able to use a very cool little software tool called &lt;a href="https://classquiz.de/"&gt;ClassQuiz&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate some of the results. Unfortunately due to some
networking issues on my side, this was a bit "clunky." Still, it was successful and fun! I've really enjoyed working with ClassQuiz. It's a tool unto my own desires.
As it mentions on the website, it's self-hostable, doesn't have tracking of any kind, and the developer has been very pleasant to work with. I had some trouble
getting the software running on a Raspberry Pi, but we got to the bottom of it, and the developer was able to encourage me to use an x86 platform for my weekend
activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://nextcloud.stanleysolutionsnw.com/apps/files_sharing/publicpreview/otMmsgzgyGHAr9j?file=/336596127_1273019789978195_4674619552819249092_n.jpg&amp;fileId=13334&amp;x=1920&amp;y=1080&amp;a=true" width="100%" alt="Oh Dear..."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where the Exercise Needs Some Improvement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned, there were some youth who did not enjoy the activity as much as others. I don't want this to overshadow how much some of the youth enjoyed
the activity -- it was still very well received, but clearly there's some work that can be done. The crux of this, I feel was a lack of opportunity for the
older youth to take on more of a leadership role. I think that this is something that I can improve with more time to prepare, and more time working through
the exercise. With every "run" of this event, it'll become more polished, and hopefully more fun! Also, I think that with more time to prepare with the youth
before the event, I'll be able to give "training" to the older members to prepare them to help with the activities. Hopefully, that will empower them to take
charge in the event, and help their younger peers; and after all, there's no better way to learn than to teach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key point I think that could use some refining is the distinction of parts in the event. We tried to do two disparate things in one exercise. Perhaps
not the best choice on my part. It wasn't a complete disaster, but it was a bit chaotic, and could use some refining. We tried to both dismantle the computers
and then install new operating systems on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, in retrospect that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem like a bad order-of-operations, and a bit prone to disaster. Luckily, pretty much everyone had a good time with it, still.
I think what we can do to improve this is just breaking out two separate workshop activities; the first of which can be attempting to upgrade computers and
load a new operating system on those machines (effectively refurbishing those old computers), and the second activity can be tearing apart the computers that
were &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dead and couldn't take a new operating system. Hindsight is 20/20, right? Well, I think I'll be able to improve it vastly for the second go-around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the networking was a bit tricky. That's my fault -- full stop. It's not that it can't, or shouldn't be done; it's that I didn't prepare well enough in
advance. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to bash myself too much, I'm just trying to point out that more could have been done in this area to make this part
smooth and useful. We weren't able to connect any of the computers to a network, and that's mostly because I didn't have the systems well-enough-prepared in
advance. And that's ok! It's something to learn from, and honestly, I don't think any of the youth really noticed. So it wasn't really a "problem."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, I think it was a very successful event. 5/7 youth were very appreciative of the exercise, and said that it was lots of fun and they would attend
again if given the chance. We were able to identify some computer hardware that could still be used, and we were able to prepare a good chunk of e-waste for
recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hopeful that I'll be able to take the activity to other counties soon, and continue to bring the event to others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See All the Pictures!&lt;/h2&gt;

Let me tell you, it was an absolute blast! I loved it! And what's more, I think the youth loved it, too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/images/kyg-2023/82D6A57A-6C3C-4C7A-860B-2C937815E372.jpeg" width="40%" alt="some of the delegates" align="right" &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to leave a few of the pictures I had taken of me during STAC this year. We had an absolute blast in Boise this President's Day weekend. Idaho 4-H delegates
from around the state in 8th and 9th grades toured the capitol, the Idaho supreme court, and other parts of Boise. They learned about the legislative and judicial branches
of Idaho state government, and they even met with the Governor of Idaho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always come away from these events realizing just how fortunate I am to get to work with some truly wonderful people, supporting such a fun and exciting program.
Participating in 4-H is a true privilege, and it's just so much fun to hang out with all those brilliant young leaders. Seeing them grow and mature is so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that really made me happy is that this year I was able to see some young 4-H'ers from Clearwater county (where I grew up) get involved in the leadership
teams organizing the event. How cool is that?! It's come a long way since when I grew up in Clearwater county, and it's exciting to see some new faces getting involved.
In fact, I think it's been nearly a decade since someone from Clearwater county was involved at this level! How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/images/kyg-2023/AB2433E4-A34B-4846-9962-8CB3E3AE689F.jpeg" width="40%" alt="some cool chaperones, too!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are there really cool youth participants, the chaperones and adults make these events so much fun. I'm reminded just how much fun it is to get to hang around
other adults that like indulging in some of the more fun parts of youth events. Being silly with the delegates, having a good time, and still carrying ourselves with
dignity. Clearly I'm still "riding the high" of the event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to send your youth to KYG, or go yourself... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO IT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="4H"></category><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Conference"></category><category term="Government"></category><category term="Learning"></category><category term="Legislature"></category><category term="Leadership"></category><category term="Capitol"></category></entry><entry><title>Photos in the Nick of Time at STAC</title><link href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/photos-in-the-nick-of-time-at-stac.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-02T11:25:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-07-02T11:25:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-07-02:/photos-in-the-nick-of-time-at-stac.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well. It was here, and now it's gone. The Idaho State Teen Association Convention, or STAC - as we fondly call it, has come and gone. It was a great week of little sleep, much excitement, and lots of smiles; but what's more, is that we had some technology wins and losses to talk about. Thank you, Python!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't like making "a big deal of myself" or patting myself on the back, but I have to say, I'm very proud of my little team's accomplishments
with this project for our Idaho State 4-H youth conference. Sure; not everything worked perfectly. Not everything was exactly what we wanted.
But that's just how some of these things go, and overall, it was a phenominal success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure what I'm talking about, let me point you at some of the other blogposts I've written on the subject...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="./react.js-python-pictures-and-4-h"&gt;React.js, Python, Pictures, and 4-H!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="./error-pages-for-education"&gt;Error Pages for Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our Wins&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/FBAC19F1-F146-4038-BCFF-0D7CF2C3CCD5.jpeg" style="width: 30%; margin: 10px;" align="right" alt="Go Team!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! We did have some big wins this year. First and foremost was that we had a great conference. The youth all really seemed to enjoy themselves,
and minor challenges and hiccups aside, all things were good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, we even had more delegates than usual! Idaho invited Washington State to bring a small delegation of youth who are going to be involved
in planning their own STAC-equivalent in Washington, next year. Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats more, we had a successful first run of our Photo Uploader Site. Hmm... I think we still need a better name, don't we? Thoughts, anyone?
Leave them in the comments. The site didn't crash, it didn't buckle, it didn't lose anything (that I didn't accidentally delete). And it didn't
go haywire in some other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, we had more than 1200 photos uploaded to &lt;a href="https://albums.idaho4h.com/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;albums.idaho4h.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, that's right. More than 1200 in
less than 4 days. Whoop, whoop! Now, in reality, there's nothing terribly impressive about this. That's not really &lt;em&gt;that many&lt;/em&gt; pictures in today's
world, but for an app built on weekends by two people who were both learning all the way through, it's a big win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Let me toot my own horn, one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest win, is that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; built this thing. I worked with a youth member who's involved (and super-clever, might I add) in some of these state
events, and together we created this tool to help all of the adults, and all of his peers to engage in a pleasant and simpler way. If you ask me,
&lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; is the biggest win. We've definatively proven that the youth are more than capable of building their own infrastructure with guidance; and,
after all, that's what 4-H is all about. The whole ethos really is &lt;em&gt;"learn by doing."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where's the Proof?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/20220619_172613.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin: 10px;" align="left" alt="Where is it all?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! You want to see the uploader? The album-site? The photos? OK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Photo Uploader&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.idaho4h.com/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;photos.idaho4h.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Albums and Pics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://albums.idaho4h.com/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;albums.idaho4h.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Source Code&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/idaho4h/4HPhotoUploader"&gt;StanleySolutions Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go browse all of the source code that our team (one of the Steering Committee youth members and myself) created, or you can go look at the
finished product (the uploader), and even take a look at the album site. The album site has a single public album where all of the photos have
been moved after they've been filtered and cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! But before you ask; yes, that filtering and cleaning &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a manual process. Someone has to go through all of them and look for anything that
shouldn't be made public before the photos become viewable. And that sorta takes us into the next topic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our Losses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/DSC_0630.JPG" style="width: 40%; margin: 10px;" align="right" alt="This clown..."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I would &lt;em&gt;LOVE&lt;/em&gt; to say that we had zero issues this year with our new tool, that just isn't the truth. We had some great failures, too.
I mean, after all, just look at that guy on the right. Would you trust him to make something that didn't have at least one or two hiccups? Me neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are all the little things that went wrong...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1) Not all Districts Were Accounted For&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Admittedly, this isn't exactly a failure, but I wanted to call it out, anyway, since there was some work to be done here, and it emphasized a
point of contention in our system. You see, we've got a hard-coded mechanism for managing district validation for the district selection. That selection
is this little section here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/district-selection.png" style="width: 55%; margin: 10px;" align="left" alt="District Selection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the code snippet below, you can see that there's a hard-coded number of options that are validated against. This isn't the only place though, the
React.js frontend also has these values hard-coded. SO... We'll need to determine a way to make those selections more discrete, and customizable. Hmm...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click to examine the district validator function...&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;validate_district&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;district_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ValidatedDistrict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    District Validation Function&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    This function validates a string providing the name of the district which&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    photos should be uploaded in association with. If the name is valid, it will&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    return `True` and the sanitized name, should the name NOT be valid, `False`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    will be returned with an empty string.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;district_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;eastern&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Eastern District&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;district_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;northern&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Northern District&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;district_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;central&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Central District&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;district_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;southern&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Southern District&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;district_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;washington&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Washington State&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t a district!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;This is a weirdly named district!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;district&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this came up last minute (Sunday night before the delegation arrived) when we were discussing the Washington-State delegation's participation
in the district competitions. Since they would be participating, we'd need them added to the list. Thankfully, due to our automated build system (thank
goodness I spent the time to get that thing working), I was able to make the code changes, verify that my changes had some bugs, fix the bugs, and deploy
- all within the time of about a half-an-hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I'll call it a loss, but there was a hidden win, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2) Limited Number of Photos in an Upload Group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all heard that joke about assumptions, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, the one that says something about making an a$$ out of you and me? That one... Well, is it not the case that in engineering, we have to make a
LOT of assumptions? Oh yeah. We do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we made an assumption about how many pictures people would want to upload at any given time. Guess we got those numbers a little wrong. We quickly
learned that people wanted to upload a lot more than 10 pictures at any given time. Dang. Good thing GitLab has bug-tracking! So I went ahead and logged
it already: https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/idaho4h/4HPhotoUploader/-/issues/48  -- Love GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3) Limited Download Access&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/20220619_172534.jpg" style="width: 40%; margin: 10px;" align="left" alt="Not Enough Access."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, another thing that we learned the hard way this year was that downloading an entire album as a zipped file isn't as easy when you're not
the web-admin (&lt;em&gt;coughs&lt;/em&gt; that's me). The teen officers (who are in charge of putting together a slide-show with all of these pictures), had one heck of a
time trying to interact with the Lychee albums app to get the pictures that they need. Now, admittedly, this is partly a combination of lack of teaching
from me, and partly general technical challenges, but in total, this application is supposed to make things easier for these youth, lowering the barrier
to entry and making the process simpler, so they have more time to enjoy the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are learning points to take away from it, as a whole. There's the sentiment of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no better time to learn something than the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if it's easier, overall, it could give the teen officers a greater opportunity to enjoy their conference. So we'll need to figure out a better
way to make those images available for download in a zip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4) Manually Screening Pictures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know me... I hate doing something that I think the computer can. That's why I consider myself an "automation engineer," I automate things; that's
what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we still have to manually screen pictures and make sure that they're appropriate, that makes a small part of me cry inside. There HAS to be a
better way. I still think there is, but I don't know what it is yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'd like to explore what those ever-present buzz-word technoligies might be able to provide. You know the ones; AI and ML. What can a little
computer-learning bring to the table? Can it identify photos that would be considered explicit, or inappropriate? We're 4-H, so we &lt;em&gt;shouldn't&lt;/em&gt; be seeing
those, anyway. But, we're working with youth. So there's always the possibility. Right? So we should have some screening mechanism in place. Even if it's
for nothing else than to remove photos that just aren't flattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Closing Thoughts and Special Thanks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrative note: We're diverging from the technical stuff, here, so if that's what you came for, you're free to take off at this point!
However, if you like the 4-H memories, stick around and read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly love participating in this event. It excites me each year to watch these young people grow and find themselves, and become true leaders. They're
going places, and I love seeing that. I'm so happy to work alongside some really cool people who make the event possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/528FB398-BCDA-435E-A3E8-EC5AF00A1F4F.jpeg" style="width: 50%" align="left" alt="These Folks Rock!"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/028EFD6B-950A-4995-B1E5-A98BF31BD10A.jpeg" style="width: 50%" align="right" alt="What goofs..."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't everyone, but it's a solid group! From left-to-right, Tara, Teresa, (yours truly), SheilAnne, and Kandee. Not pictured are Carrie and Mike
who help to "round out" the remaining adults on the STAC Steering Committe. They're all a great group of folks to work with, and spend time with. I
couldn't be happier to collaborate with them. Of course, I'd be remiss to ignore the fact that there's plenty of youth wha also make up the team. They
all make it so much fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dr. Lindstrom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit of a sap, so I want to end on this sappy note. Think of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to believe that nine years ago was &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; first time attending this conference as a youth, myself. That year was a wild and wonderful ride; I
learned so much. That was also Dr. Jim Lindstrom's first year as the Idaho State 4-H Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/DSC_0925.JPG" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px;" align="right" alt="Dr. Lindstrom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to spend too much time pounding on this point, but I want to leave a lasting "Thank You," right here. There's a lot that has gone on
behind the scenes in the state. I'm glad to have been able to have seen some of these trials and tribulations, so that I might understand a small part
of the process. It takes an army, not just a villiage, to keep a state 4-H program strong, and ours is. We have wonderful volunteers, leaders, parents
youth, educators, and 4-H professionals. Many times, there are folks who wear several of those hats all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lindstrom has been behind this development for that entire time. He's worked diligently to keep the pipelines flowing and keep all of those folks
engaged. I still remember sitting with Dr. Lindstrom at our formal banquet the first year at STAC and talking to him about what projects I was taking
that year, and what I enjoyed about 4-H in the state. This is Dr. Lindstrom's last year, and it's been wonderful to reflect on all of the great things
that the state has accomplished over these years, and I'm so thankful for Jim's leadership, care, and persistence. He's been a solid guide, and a true
leader. The sort of person we all hope to "grow up to be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Dr. Lindstrom! May Idaho 4-H continue to reap the benefits of all the greatness you've sewn, and may you be able to look back on it with
fond memories of all the youth who've seen tremendous growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last thing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep Making the Best Better.&lt;/p&gt;

That, after all, is the ethos of 4-H. The very esence of how 4-H teaches youth effective life-skills every day. This "photo upload app" that I've been working on relies on some of the newest, prettiest, fanciest web framework technologies available to make the common user-interaction experience very smooth so that youth may engage in digital activities easily, without having to learn new hoops to jump through. Still, it's being built &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; youth, &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; youth, so wouldn't it be disappointing if there weren't aspects that were clearly touched by youth? Clearly inspired by them? Sharing their energy and creativity?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Errors are a given when it comes to computers. Heck, they're a given when it comes to most technology. We're all familiar with the &lt;em&gt;"dreaded 404"&lt;/em&gt; that's
presented to users when a page or resource can't be found. That doesn't mean that they have to be boring! After all, the text "404" on screen is plain;
uninteresting. Wouldn't it be disingenuous to use just plain text for a web-service that's exciting and interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enter Youth-Designed Error Pages!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/err404.png" style="width: 100%" alt="404 Error Page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 404 page was designed by the youth that I'm working with. It gives some flavor to the site when something goes wrong. Admittedly, it's never the goal
for things &lt;em&gt;to go wrong,&lt;/em&gt; but when it (inevitably) happens, we're ready!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to introduce the 4-H member who's helping me to a little "old-fasioned" web design. Crafting plain &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; and putting it all together
for the specific purposes of showing errors, but that's not exactly &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; when you're just starting out. I also wanted to capture some of the "flare" and
creativity that 4-H members always seem to have. After all, isn't part of the fun of any development project putting in the easter eggs? I think so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that leaves me with two clear goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Youth-designed static HTML/CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing creativity of youth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said... It's not easy to just spin HTML off the cuff when you've never done any of it before in your life! Especially when we're talking about full-
fledged pages that have pretty formatting and the like. What to do... what to do...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter: Microsoft Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.redd.it/1s0rlfdtsvg61.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Ultimate IDE?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's right. The ultimate IDE... Well, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Microsoft Word may not be a good IDE by most (sane) people's standards, but that doesn't mean that we can't use it for a little visual assistance.
One thing that Word does have going for it in this space is the ability to easily format pages with text, images, formatting, and more. All in a convenient
interface. After all, isn't that the reason that most of the world uses MS Word instead of LaTeX?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this convenience, it's pretty easy to put some images together, add some text, center it how you want, and publish! Did I mention two key features?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word has an web-page viewing mode to present the page as how it might appear in a browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word natively supports saving a file as &lt;code&gt;*.htm&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;*.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that I could get anyone started with creating the pages, and worrying less about the HTML and more about how they want the pages to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bumps in the Proverbial "Information Superhighway"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's all well and good; quite simple really, but here's where the rubber hits the &lt;code&gt;10101001010010101010010101010010100010101111&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes time to publish these pages, it's pretty simple, the whole repository that we're working in is based around the separation of a frontend and
a backend. The backend houses all the Python goodness, and all of the static and template files that are rendered and loaded for web-serving. That means
that if we want to host specific files for error pages, we can split them up and distribute them accordingly into the backend directories like shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someErrPage_files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;supporting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someOtherErrPage_files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;supporting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;templates&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someErrPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someOtherErrPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- main.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we "export" or save the rendered error page from Word, we end up generating a single HTML file, and a folder full of supporting files. Everything
from CSS, to XML, to images, and more. Since that's all static stuff, we can stick it in a sub-folder under the &lt;code&gt;backend/static&lt;/code&gt; directory. The plain HTML
file, on the other hand, goes to the &lt;code&gt;backend/templates&lt;/code&gt; folder where it will be pulled from by Jinja in Python and rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to all of this, is getting paths right. After all, pirates didn't find their treasure if they meant "paces" when they said "leagues" right?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In much the same way, when Word generates those files, it assumes a certain path. It assumes that the folder containing all support files is colocated with
the HTML file, in the same directory. Clearly, here, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation is for good reason though, all of the support files are static, they're not templates. We wouldn't ever want Jinja to attempt rendering
any one of them, so they go in the &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directory. Simple as that. Now, the Python server already knows to route accordingly for static files, after
all, early on, it uses a static router for FastAPI to do the lifting here, and it also sets up the templates structure accordingly so as to make Jinja
rendering easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Application Base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FastAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on_event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;startup&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;startup_event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Event that Only Runs When App is Starting&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Mount the Static File Path&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/static&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StaticFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;static&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;static&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Jinja2Templates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;templates&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice however, that for FastAPI to "catch" any such requests, it needs to see a URI with the prefix of &lt;code&gt;/static&lt;/code&gt;. Are you beginning to see the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, because MS Word doesn't include that prefix, the web-client will unknowingly ask for files that don't exist, and FastAPI will throw up its
hands in defeat. Now, that's not all bad, since they're all just plain files, we can edit the HTML quite easily, and with a tweak or two, we can add the
prefix where it's needed. It took me a bit to figure out exactly where this needed to be done, but when I did, it was very straight forward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let you be the judge here. You've already seen the 404, but here's the 501 and 503:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/err501.png" style="width: 100%" alt="404 Error Page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very satisfied with the results; they pages are clever, cute, and most of all, they're genuine and showcase the very esence of learning and exploring
with 4-H. That all makes me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/err503.png" style="width: 100%" alt="404 Error Page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Them Stand Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be able to show off these pages whenever I want. After all, it would kinda suck to only be able to see them when there's a legitimate
error. That would make it very difficult to show them to passers-by! So, we did a little function-crafting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# HTTP Error Response&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;page404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TemplateResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;404.htm&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;request&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exception_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StarletteHTTPException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;custom_http_exception_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StarletteHTTPException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;503&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See here, that we were able to create three unique web-endpoints with FastAPI for each of the error pages, and then we could wrap them in the single error
handler. This means that when a user goes to &lt;code&gt;https://develop.idaho4h.com/404&lt;/code&gt; they actually see the 404 page without generating a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; 404. The same is
true for the other two errors, making the whole thing pretty slick, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess I'm tooting my own horn pretty loudly, at this point, aren't I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it's been lots of fun getting to work with youth to make these custom error pages and show them off! It really helps demonstrate the work
that this 4-H member has put in!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Youth"></category><category term="4-H"></category><category term="Education"></category><category term="Development"></category><category term="HTTP"></category><category term="HTML"></category><category term="Status-Codes"></category></entry><entry><title>Automagic Test Websites</title><link href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/automagic-test-websites.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-22T18:32:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-03-23T14:49:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-03-22:/automagic-test-websites.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I've been working with a 4-H member to develop and build a smart, simple, and elegant web-application for 4-H members to upload photos they take while participating in a youth conference. Since I'm working with a 4-H member to develop the website, everything needs to have a focus on education, and I need to spend as little time as possible fussing with the infrastructure side of things, since that's not what we're focusing on. I decided that we should make a system using my self-hosted GitLab and Jenkins instances to automagically deploy changes so that the youth doesn't have to learn how that's done, and fight with the server all the time!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, I've been working on some fun and interesting stuff with some 4-H members over the last few months. We're developing a
&lt;a href="/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html"&gt;Python-based photo-upload-app&lt;/a&gt; to allow 4-H youth (delegates) at a youth conference upload photos securely
to participate in competitions during the conference, and to share photos for the end-of-conference-slideshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm not here to talk about the app; I'll be doing plenty more of that, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am here to talk about is how I'm making it automatically deploy the application for
&lt;a href="https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/idaho4h/4HPhotoUploader"&gt;each development branch in my GitLab instance&lt;/a&gt; automatically with a little Jenkins magic.
You see, since I have a personal Jenkins instance set up to work with my GitLab, it's able to authenticate and pull all of the source-code from any branch
in whichever repository I configure. Better yet, I can make it automatically look for changes to any-and-all branches, and automatically run builds when
those branches change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've just described is nothing new to those who work in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) systems, but it is valuable and, I think,
novel in this context. I'm using this automated build system to abstract the complexity of deploying a containerized application so that I can focus on
development with a youth member, and focus on programming, not deploying servers. Using Jenkins, in this way, the 4-H'er that I'm working with can write
his own code in GitLab's built in editor, so he doesn't need to learn &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and he can commit his work, and watch it automatically deploy for him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I'm Making the Magic Happen with Jenkins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... Like I said, Jenkins is doing most of the heavy lifting here. It's looking for changes, then running builds when those changes appear; but Jenkins
isn't the &lt;em&gt;hosting server&lt;/em&gt;, itself, it's just the CI server. In fact, I'm using a Linode server which is configured and provisioned as a Jenkins agent (as
far as my Jenkins instance is concerned) that has NGINX, Python, Docker, and docker-compose installed to do the heavy lifting. This way, I can make it all
come together quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline, in a nutshell, looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/images/jenkins_4h_deployment.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Jenkins Pipeline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's walk through those stages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1) Prep&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much what it sounds like. Pull down the repo source, do any other setup that's necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably though, this stage actually URL-ifies the branch name. In other words, it sanitizes the branch-name to make it appropriate for a unique
subdomain-name. This is kinda critical. Each branch will end up getting its own subdomain under the &lt;code&gt;idaho4h.com&lt;/code&gt; domain that's filed for this server.
The process is pretty simple, really, just replace whitespace and slashes with dashes so that it's a "legal" subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the function I use to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;urlifyBranchName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;quot;Sanitize&amp;quot; the Branch Name as a Sub-Domain Name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// i.e., https://&amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;.idaho4h.com/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2) Test Python&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one's pretty simple. Since Python is holding up the backend, I want to run some tests. This is pretty much unit-test only (no functional or
integration tests, here - yet), but it allows us to check some of the simple sanitizer functions we're going to count on for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adittedly, I had a bit of trouble with some of the virtual-environment stuff, and haven't gotten back around to fixing that yet, so for now just ignore
the title of the function. The execution is pretty simple. pip-install the requirements we need, then run &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;runPythonTestsInVirtualEnv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Test Python&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Install Requirements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;python3 -m pip install -r ${WORKSPACE}/${requirementsFile}&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Run `pytest`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pytest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3) Build the Frontend&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole project relies on a Python backend, and a React.js frontend. I need to get around to documenting this whole intertie a little better, but for
now, just know that there are two root folders. One for the frontend, the other for the backend. When building the whole thing, we build and export the
frontend and shove it into the static folder of the backend. Python can then serve all of the javascript, html, and css files from there. Pretty simple,
really (took a while to figure out, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this stage does can be summarized as follows: install npm resources, fix what audit warnings can be handled, build the artifacts. Fairly simple!
Again though, I'll note that there is some prior setup required to make the whole npm ecosystem "happy" with the structure of the frontend folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;buildReactFrontend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;React Frontend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;frontend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Ensure all Packages are Installed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm install&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Attempt to Resolve Reported Vulnerabilities&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm audit fix || true&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Don&amp;#39;t fail on normal warning&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use the Build Tooling&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm run build&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4) Dockerize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole thing runs in a little docker container. Pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Dockerfile for Idaho 4-H Photo Upload Service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;python:3.9&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/server&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;./backend&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/server

&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--no-cache-dir&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--upgrade&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/server/requirements.txt

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Run Server on localhost:8383 so Nginx can Hit it without Direct Extern. Access&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;uvicorn&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;main:app&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;--host&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;0.0.0.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;--port&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;80&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;--log-config&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;log_conf.yml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we just dockerize the Python application after pulling all of its backend source contents into one spot. This whole container is then built and
deployed with a little docker-compose magic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;3.9&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Web-UI is Defined by Local &amp;quot;Dockerfile&amp;quot;, Must Be Rebuilt Each Time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;webui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;./Dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;$NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT:80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;$RESTART_POLICY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;LYCHEE_API_USER&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;LYCHEE_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the use of a few things, we've got several environment variables in that docker-compose file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/code&gt; Defines the port that should be used on the host system such that NGINX may pass it traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RESTART_POLICY&lt;/code&gt; Defines whether or not the container should restart automatically, this is only set for the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LYCHEE_API_USER&lt;/code&gt; Calls out that a local environment variable should be pulled from Jenkins to declare the username to use for Lychee access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LYCHEE_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; As for the username, calls out reference to what Jenkins provides as the password (token) for the API access to Lychee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is all leveraged in Jenkins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;buildDockerContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Docker Container&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Check for &amp;quot;Default&amp;quot; Conditions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// MAIN and DEVELOP Branches Should Have Consistent Ports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Their Containers Should Also Restart Automatically&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;8000&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;RESTART_POLICY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;always&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;develop&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;8001&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;RESTART_POLICY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;always&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Provide credentials to the docker-compose script so that&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// container will reference the Lychee API credentials.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;withCredentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usernamePassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;credentialsId:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;idaho4hapi&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;usernameVariable:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;LYCHEE_API_USER&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;passwordVariable:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;LYCHEE_API_TOKEN&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Build the Container - Using the Branch-Name as Env Var&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;docker-compose up -d --build&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins scripting is responsible for doing a few things. First and foremost, if the branch is one of the "static" branches (&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;),
it's given a static port (the same as the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; time this branch was deployed). If it's not one of the key branches, then it's given the next available
port, one that comes from a file on the host OS and is incremented each time there's a new deployment. Admittedly, this is a bit intense, and it makes
the port move a little more than it probably needs to, but it does ensure somewhat robust port management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the port number is being decided, the restart-policy may be updated. You see, the default restart policy is &lt;code&gt;"no"&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the
container should NOT restart if it were to fail, or the host OS were to restart; however, that's not the behavior we want for the "static" branches. They
should restart whenever possible! And that's exactly what the &lt;code&gt;RESTART_POLICY&lt;/code&gt; environmental override does. It updates the restart policy fro &lt;code&gt;"no"&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;"always"&lt;/code&gt; for the static branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next piece of the script is to run the docker-compose command, but notice how that's done in the context of a &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; block. This allows
Jenkins to provision the Lyche credentials to environmental variables that docker-compose can reference and inject into the container at build-time. This
gives us the ability to launch the container with the appropriate credentials, while securing them in Jenkins and avoiding the need to have them stored as
a static file either in GitLab, or on the server, itself. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5) Deploy in NGINX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who likes typing in the specific port for the web-service they want to use... or better yet, besides the nerdier of us who know about it... who would even think of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly where NGINX comes in in this case. NGINX does all of the proxying for me on this server. What's a proxy? you ask. Well, according to
the Merriam-Webster dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;proxy (noun)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\ ˈpräk-sē  \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the agency, function, or office of a deputy who acts as a substitute for another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, NGINX &lt;em&gt;proxies&lt;/em&gt; or represents each of the various services and, in turn, passes web requests to them. So for each new branch, I need to create a new proxy for the associated, url-ified branch name to pass to the specific application port that the container is listening on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's done pretty simply by running a little Python script to generate the NGINX configuration, then we restart NGINX to accept the new config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;deployContainerInNginx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Deploy in NGINX&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Generate the NGINX Config File&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;python3 ./writeNginxConfig.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Restart NGINX To Apply Config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;sudo /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That little Python script helps us out too, it basically sucks in a few of the environmental variables to determine how the configuration should be written
(or if it should be written at all - it's not written for &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branches). After slurping up those environmental variables, it writes out a
new file with the configuration into NGINX's sites-enabled directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;deployNginx.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;A deployment helper script to automate the addition of new NGINX configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;files in the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;PORT_VAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;BRANCH_VAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;NGINX_CONFIG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6) Wrap Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much exactly what it sounds like, this final stage just puts things "away" after the fact. The primary purpose of this operation is just to store
the configuration for the TCP port to use for Docker the next time around. It's all simplified with the use of a Python file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;updatePort.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;A deployment helper script to automate the &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; of the container port file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;to coordinate cross-branch container deployments.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;PORT_VAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole automated flow allows me to keep builds going auto-magically so that I can work with a 4-H youth member to develop this simple little
photo-upload app without having to go too deep into the weeds with all of the development nightmares, we can focus on the basics of the code, and then let
the automated system keep it all moving along for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we spend MORE time on learning, and LESS time on fighting the system! In theory, at least...&lt;/p&gt;

It's been a while since I've been very involved in swine projects in 4-H, but it's been good getting back into the swing of things. Admmittedly, I'm learning new things all the time, myself, but since the ethos of 4-H is "Learn by Doing," I'm always one for good, tangible, hands-on exercises to help engage youth while teaching. I thought it about time that I share a few of my ideas!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm just getting back into the swing of 4-H activities. Monthly community meetings, regular project meetings, etc. But I want to bring some exciting new
learning activities to the projects I'm supporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent... gosh... 10(?) years in the swine project, about 8 of which were both in market and breeding projects, so quite a bit of time around those pigs!
Well worth it, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm getting started with leading, I've been starting to amass some of the ideas I've had for learning exercise. Some are borrowed, and some are of my
own creation. This article will chronicle some of those ideas; both the good, and the... interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Bad Water”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/18/85/23/360_F_118852383_kjyToVFqvQ9T1rNlfrYQuYiAlmtqZTU9.jpg"
    width="300" alt="Dirty Water" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;image credit: &lt;a href="https://stock.adobe.com/hu/search/images?k=dirty+water+glass"&gt;Adobe Stock Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I can't claim that this was my idea (thanks, Roxanne!); but I'll shamelessly use it, because... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean water is essential! Most of us know this, and some of us have first-hand experience with the alternatives and their repercussions, but it's very
important to instill this &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; in youth who are raising livestock (not just pigs). I think most of the reasons are pretty self-expanitory, but I'll
list some of them, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hogs who don't have access to clean water...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...are often unhealthy, prone to disease; if not because of pathogens in the water, because of lack of hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...rarely gain weight optimally. Their bodies are too preoccupied with surviving to pack on muscle the way we want them to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...can become aggressive over clean water, or become lethargic, not getting the exercise they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the exercise that Roxanne so graciously provided me brings together Sprite, and soda-water. One is pretty universally enjoyed by young people, the
other almost the opposite. Fill so many cups that each 4-H'er can have a cup to themselves, splitting the pour right down the middle. Half the cups get
Sprite, the other half get soda-water. Be sure not to over-fill the cups so that the kiddos will need to pee too quickly. Tell all of the kids that you've
got some "soda" that they can drink, but don't tell them that some are better than the others. Let them all take a cup and have a drink. After you get the
usual "grumblings" and complaints, offer the kids more if they'd like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the kids who had Sprite will likely get more, the others may, or may not. It's probably a good time to ask the kids who &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; didn't
like their drinks what they didn't like about it. This all, of course, leads right in to a perfect opportunity for you to talk about the importance of
fresh, clean clean water, and how having anything other than good clean water will likely make pigs less likely to drink anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty fun, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Withdrawl Period”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, admittedly, this one's still in the incubator... gonna have to work on the scheme a little more still before it's where I want it. But here's the
general idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, livestock medications have what's known as a "withdrawl period;" a length of time after which the animal should not be harvested for
risk of the medication still being present in their system and likely in their meat. In general, it's considered &lt;em&gt;unwise&lt;/em&gt; to eat meat which still has
any measurable level of medicine. This is important for 4-H youth to understand, because they're responsible for the care of their animal right up to its
harvest, which means that if they were to administer medicine to the animal within the withdrawl period, they could be contaminating the animal's meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The withdrawl period is brought up a few times throughout the year, and my idea is to show the kiddos how to experience it, first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said... still needs some work, but the idea basically surrounds Asparagus. Yep, that's right. You might already be two steps ahead of me here, but
if you're not quite with me yet, let me remind you of that one-so-ever-fascinating-trait of Asparagus; after you eat enough of it, when you pee, you can smell it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. I went there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, we're dealing with kids, here! That stuff is funny, and it can have a big impact! Imagine being a kid and having somme kind of Asparagus-based treat one day when you hear about "Withdral Periods," and then remembering it when you go to pee the next! Talk about a first-hand lesson!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Worms and Nutrition”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok... so this one could be viewed as a bit... unorthodox. Anywho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parasites are always a problem with livestock, and it's important to deworm animals somewhat regularly. Especially when you're trying to help those
animals acheive certain growth rates! A lot of people who raise hogs don't worm them for one reason or another. Some because it's introducing "yet
another manmade thing into the pigs," some becuase it can be difficult, and others because it's either cost prohibitive or they merely don't want to
pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it's important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what if we showed the kids just how much those "worms" can actually eat up from the nutritional input that our hogs digest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is essentially to have two glasses of colored water filled to the same level. Then, demonstrate the difference between a young worm and an adult
one by showing how much each would eat if the way they ate was to absorb water. Take a Q-tip (representing the young worm) and dip it in one glass and let
it sit there for a bit. Take it out and demonstrate that it absorbed a little of the "nutrients" but not very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've shown them the "young" worm, bring out a super-ultra-mega-absorbant tampon. You read that correctly. I think that some folks might find this
a bit... odd, but I think it would provide a good teaching opportunity. Anyway... Take out that &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; tampon, pull it out of its packaging and place it in
the second glass. Let it soak up the "nutrients" for a little bit, then pull it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After both "worms" have been removed, have the kids get close and examine the difference in how much of the "nutrients" have been taken away from the pig.
The pig who received wormer, and only has young worms still has lots of nutrients for themselves. The pig who &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; receive wormer doesn't have quite
the same luxury, they've lost a substantial ammount of nutrition, because the worm "ate" it all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Mold Growth and Clean Feed”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5f4d18f6bb023d54b55e4e19/master/pass/Science_penicillum_922527614.jpg"
    width="300" alt="Dirty Water" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;image credit: &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grim-reality-reopening-more-mold-offices-schools-houses/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many 4-H'ers will buy feed in bulk at the beginning of the season so that they can take it at lower cost. This often means one &lt;em&gt;GREAT BIG&lt;/em&gt; sack of feed
sitting around all summer, which may not be the best option... Why? you ask... Well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When feed is left to sit for long periods of time, it regularly absorbs moisture, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but with moisture often comes mold.
The longer that feed sits, the more moisture it will gradually absorb, and as it absorbs more moisture, it will begin to break down, creating additional
heat, and making a terrific environment to support the growth of mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know anyone who &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; mold? Me neither. And pigs don't either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like us, pigs can tolerate small ammounts of mold if they eat it accidentally; but they they don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; it! It doesn't &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; good! It's not good
&lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this last "experiment" I want to demonstrate is the progression of a person's plate of food over a month. It's a hands-on activity where the kids help
me fill my plate with food, and I can stick it in a refrigerator for the period of one month to bring it back and show them later. At the same time, I'll
store some pig food in a warm, moist place where it can naturally grow mold. I'll take photos of it every day so that I can make a time-lapse video of its
moldy progression, then with the kids, we can look at all the &lt;em&gt;gross mold!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I'm weird. It's ok, you don't need to remind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What'll be fun about this exercise, though is that the kids will see first hand how just keeping food for long periods of time can let it grow mold, and
how it really doesn't take much for it to happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I think I had some other ideas too... but I've forgotten them. At least I wrote them down on a piece of paper at home! Will have to go look at
those later and report back!&lt;/p&gt;

This article will look at how we're using Lychee, Python, FastAPI, and React.js to make an ultra-simple, highly effective photo upload service for a youth conference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've been keeping tabs on what I've been up to lately, you might know that I've been slowly getting back into 4-H
involvement. Namely, I'm now a certified volunteer in Idaho, and I'm starting to dip my toes into leading projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I shared &lt;a href="/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html"&gt;how I'm working with youth to create an app in Python and React.js&lt;/a&gt;
and how I'm excited to be working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; some of the youth to develop the app. We're working to use some of the "latest and
greatest" technology to ensure that the service is not only forward-looking, but helps to teach forward-looking practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article though, I want to talk a bit more about the technical details about what we're doing, and how it's working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let's talk program organization...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole program is structured around Lychee as the "database". Since Lychee provides a beautiful, functional API,
and an easily maintained container-based database and storage, we can use it as the core of the service. Lychee
provides simple, but powerful album organization, and that's all available through the API (excellent!!!). Since
the entire goal is to provide a simple way to organize photos according to the "district" that submits them, we'll
be able to use the API to poke those photos into just the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be the responsibility of our Python back-end (using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pychee/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pychee&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to make the
connection between the React front-end and the Lychee service itself. This same Python back-end will serve the
React public files. Effectively, like so many other places I use Python, it acts as the all-important glue in this
system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The React front end is basically passive in this configuration, by that, I mean there's no Javascript/Node.js
server configuration on the box. It's all built and exported to static files that Python serves as needed to
"pull up" the site. Once the site is loaded, the React.js front-end just hits the appropriate API endpoints on
the Python side which, in turn, causes the Python service to access the appropriate API endpoints on the Lychee
service using a specific API credential-set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more going on in the automated build system that helps me work with youth to deploy the site in
the various stages of development so that the youth don't have to learn all of the intricacies of Node.js'
awful dependency stack. That said, I'll have to write more (hopefully soon) on how we tied my personal Jenkins
service with the Linode that this system is running on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="React.Js"></category><category term="Microservice"></category><category term="Docker"></category><category term="Lychee"></category><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Development"></category><category term="Fastapi"></category></entry><entry><title>Think you Know Everything?</title><link href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/think-you-know-everything.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-08T19:50:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-09T07:54:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-02-08:/think-you-know-everything.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A step back down memory-lane, I pulled out the ol' 'Quiz Board' for a presentation!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is gonna be a quick one, but I just wanted to share some photos of my old high-school
engineering project, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Quiz Board"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a project of mine to make a &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;
and engaging public education system. I used it at the county fair to help teach folks about
swine, since that was my 4-H project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/22-02-08 17-02-31 1227.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Quiz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago, in a town far away, I was given an old "quiz board" to fix. It was literally a board,
and it had screws protruding from both sides. The system was simple. There were questions printed
on the left side, answers printed on the right. If you connected the provided wires using connected
alligator clips the board would tell you if you were "right" by illuminating an little bulb.
Pretty neat little idea for kids, you connect a wire on the left to select the question, then you
can connect the wire on the right to select an answer. If you were right, the bulb lights up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But it was boring!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, I thought it was. There was no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; feedback from the system if you got the answer
wrong, and it was kinda sad, for that reason. Needless to say, I wasn't satisfied. It wasn't long
after I repaired that board before I was starting to mull over ideas of how I could make my own
and improve upon the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, I was learning about how Walt Disney had used rotating "drums" with little
depressions to make practical control systems before precise timing in microcontrollers was easy
and practical. I distinctly remember an old clip from some archive of Walt giving a tour of some
of the Haunted Mansion Audio-Animatronic control systems, and showing how these big rotating drums
would depress and release valve controlls for the pneumatics. These valves would then, in turn,
operate the cylinders responsible for actually moving the animatronics around, and by coordinating
all of these depressions at just the right speed and timing, the Disney Imagineers could craft
some spectacular repeating animations. Wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked that idea, and I had NO idea how microcontrollers worked. I didn't even have an Arduino
yet, and I had never even seen real software code (needless to say, my parents were not the
biggest tech-geeks in the area). So I started mulling this over. After what must've been a few
months (really, I can't remember), an idea came to me. I realized that those little snap-action
switches have two positions, one defaulting to ON, the other defaulting to OFF; more commonly
referred to as "Normally Closed" and "Normally Open," respectively. That meant that I could use
two switches pretty easily to "route" electricity for a couple of buttons labeled "TRUE" and
"FALSE". The switch associated with the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; answer would be pressed, the other would not.
That meant that I could easily "line-up" the switches so that if the user pressed the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;
button, it would turn on a green light, and if they pressed the wrong button, it would turn on
the red light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, "The Quiz" was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/22-02-08 16-59-31 1225.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Guts"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Processing with Electro-Mechanical Logic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love touting that this machine had a 3-bit processor; which, if you stretch your imagination
a little bit, I guess that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true since it had three switches, and their positions all
mattered for the result of the question/answer. I've already explained what two of the switches
were for, but that third switch was responsible for keeping the whole thing moving in just the
right way. That's right, that last switch was responsible for controlling the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole system revolved -pun intended- around this rotating drum idea. Questions were printed
on a sheet of paper taped to a 4" diameter piece of PVC pipe, and the pipe turned to line the
questions up with a "viewing window" in the face of this gargantuan machine. When the user
pressed "start" that would deactivate the "constant" source of power for the motor, so as soon
as the next switch press happens, the motor would stop. This would, in turn, line up the
question with the viewing window, and then the user could read and respond to the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole project took my father and I much of the year to build. In all, probably between one-
and two-hundred hours, total. When it was finally completed, I got to take the machine with me
to the Clearwater County fair, and load it up with questions about pigs to help entertain and
educate the public.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Analog"></category><category term="Logic"></category><category term="4-H"></category><category term="Knowledge"></category><category term="Throwback"></category></entry><entry><title>React.js, Python, Pictures, and 4-H!</title><link href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-26T17:35:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-26T17:35:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-01-26:/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you get nearly one-hundred high-school age youth to collect nearly as many photos for a competition at a youth conference? Facebook? Google-Drive? How about Python...?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you remember going to those youth conferences when you were younger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Idaho 4-H, there's an annual conference known as the
&lt;a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/extension/4h/events/stac"&gt;"State Teen Association Convention,"&lt;/a&gt; though, admittedly,
when I attended, it was known as "Teen Conference." Essentially, it's a conference focused on giving youth from
around the state the opportunity to explore what opportunities exist after high school. Youth get to spend about
four days on campus at the University of Idaho, and explore various career- and education-focused "tracks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what would a youth-conference be, without some social activities and competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idaho "STAC" has a number of social activities and competitions in addition to the educational portions to help
bring youth across the state together and help them build new connections. One of the competitions that happens
throughout the conference is what's known as "district competitions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the districts, and what are the district competitions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the state of Idaho is broken into four regional districts: Northern, Southern, Central, and Eastern. The
districts help keep some organization across the state, and at STAC, they are the dividing line(s) for youth
meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the conference the districts compete against one another for points in district competitions. After
all, who doesn't like a little good-humored, friendly competition? Now, to be honest, I don't think that there's
any specific "prize" to come out of winning, but it's a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are competitions focusing in a few key areas including creativity (photo contest, skit performances) and
healthy living (skit/dance performances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The challenge...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo competition is always an interesting challenge to host. It ends up becoming something of a technical
challenge to administer since there's no "effective" way to collect the photos into one place. In years past
all forms of systems have been used; everything from Facebook with hashtags, to public Google Drives, email, and
more... It's been a pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year something dawned on me, we could create something a little more interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we created a simple little web-app to allow the youth to upload the photos they take for the competition,
and made it a requirement for the youth to agree to a photo-consent-release. So that's what we got started on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time a few months back doing some research on what we could use for an effective photo storage system.
I wanted to use an open-source project that would allow API-based access to upload photos, and whose management
is simple, intuitive, and without too many frills. I did some poking around, and playing with different services
on a $5/month Linode (love those things for testing, by-the-way), and I finally landed on
&lt;a href="https://lycheeorg.github.io/"&gt;Lychee&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a terrific, and simple &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; configuration provided by &lt;a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-lychee"&gt;LinuxServer.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API is VERY WELL documented, and exceedingly simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's already a &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pychee/"&gt;Python Lychee client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user interface is very simple and focused without too many frills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Lychee as the "back-end storage" for this project, I can create a nice "wrapper" on the front to make an easy
web-app to allow youth delegates to upload their photos. To do that, I can use my slick little Python/React.js
integrated web-server pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to see what it's looking like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Other Perks:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty early on in this project's investigation, I met a 4-H'er who is actually learning about some programming, and
so we've been working together on developing the web-front-end interface for youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got quite a bit more fun stories to tell about how we're using my GitLab and Jenkins instances to help us keep
this project moving, but that will be coming a little later. That said, take a look at the consent form that we've built,
and the dark-mode that we were able to build!&lt;/p&gt;
