What's more, it's not common for people to really understand what parts make up a computer, and how they can be used.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 12:13:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2023-03-19:/dissecting-computers-for-the-first-time.html</guid><category>Youth</category><category>4H</category><category>Youth</category><category>Computers</category><category>Workshop</category><category>Teen</category><category>Learning</category><category>Education</category><category>Hands-On</category><category>Recycling</category><category>Technology</category><category>Linux</category></item><item><title>KYG 2023</title><link>https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/kyg-2023.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to participate in the Idaho 4-H "Know Your Government" (KYG) Conference in Boise this past weekend.

And what's more, I think the youth loved it, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 21:19:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2023-02-21:/kyg-2023.html</guid><category>Youth</category><category>4H</category><category>Youth</category><category>Conference</category><category>Government</category><category>Learning</category><category>Legislature</category><category>Leadership</category><category>Capitol</category></item><item><title>Photos in the Nick of Time at STAC</title><link>https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/photos-in-the-nick-of-time-at-stac.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well. It was here, and now it's gone. The Idaho State Teen Association Convention, or STAC - as we fondly call it, has come and gone. It was a great week of little sleep, much excitement, and lots of smiles; but what's more, is that we had some technology wins and losses to talk about. Thank you, Python!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 11:25:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-07-02:/photos-in-the-nick-of-time-at-stac.html</guid><category>Youth</category><category>Python</category><category>React.Js</category><category>4H</category><category>Fastapi</category><category>Materialui</category><category>Linode</category></item><item><title>Error Pages for Education</title><link>https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/error-pages-for-education.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What better way to learn, then by doing. That, after all, is the ethos of 4-H. The very esence of how 4-H teaches youth effective life-skills every day. This "photo upload app" that I've been working on relies on some of the newest, prettiest, fanciest web framework technologies available to make the common user-interaction experience very smooth so that youth may engage in digital activities easily, without having to learn new hoops to jump through. Still, it's being built &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; youth, &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; youth, so wouldn't it be disappointing if there weren't aspects that were clearly touched by youth? Clearly inspired by them? Sharing their energy and creativity?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 17:04:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-03-29:/error-pages-for-education.html</guid><category>Youth</category><category>Youth</category><category>4-H</category><category>Education</category><category>Development</category><category>HTTP</category><category>HTML</category><category>Status-Codes</category></item><item><title>Automagic Test Websites</title><link>https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/automagic-test-websites.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I've been working with a 4-H member to develop and build a smart, simple, and elegant web-application for 4-H members to upload photos they take while participating in a youth conference. Since I'm working with a 4-H member to develop the website, everything needs to have a focus on education, and I need to spend as little time as possible fussing with the infrastructure side of things, since that's not what we're focusing on. I decided that we should make a system using my self-hosted GitLab and Jenkins instances to automagically deploy changes so that the youth doesn't have to learn how that's done, and fight with the server all the time!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 18:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-03-22:/automagic-test-websites.html</guid><category>Youth</category><category>Youth</category><category>4-H</category><category>Education</category><category>Jenkins</category><category>NGINX</category><category>Docker</category><category>Docker-Compose</category><category>Development</category><category>CI</category><category>CI-CD</category><category>Self-Hosted</category><category>Gitlab</category></item><item><title>Ideas for Swine Education</title><link>https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/ideas-for-swine-education.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently attended the 2022 University of Idaho, Washington State University joint Youth Swine Field day in Asotin, WA. It's been a while since I've been very involved in swine projects in 4-H, but it's been good getting back into the swing of things. Admmittedly, I'm learning new things all the time, myself, but since the ethos of 4-H is "Learn by Doing," I'm always one for good, tangible, hands-on exercises to help engage youth while teaching. I thought it about time that I share a few of my ideas!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Stanley</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 16:54:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com,2022-03-22:/ideas-for-swine-education.html</guid><category>Youth</category><category>Youth</category><category>Swine</category><category>4-H</category><category>Livestock</category><category>Education</category></item><item><title>Using Python to Provide Simple Photo Connections for Youth</title><link>https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/using-python-to-provide-simple-photo-connections-for-youth.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So if you're gonna use Python to help bring photos from youth together; how, exactly, do you do it?
