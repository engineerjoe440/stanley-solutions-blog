Progress may be slow, but it's incremental, and we're approaching goals, which is always exciting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Quick! Recap what's being researched...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I'm very thankful that I've been able to sponsor two different projects. A continuation project from
last year's &lt;a href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/hearing-fires-while-seeing-smoke.html"&gt;wildfire detection project&lt;/a&gt;
and a continuation of my own Capstone project, a &lt;a href="http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Biochar_Production_System"&gt;biochar reactor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wildfire Detector (Team FireSense)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already talked a lot about this project, so I'm not going to do that here. If you'd like to read up on it more, feel free to check out some of the links
above to the articles I've written previously. Otherwise, check out this year's team poster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've talked less about this project here in my blog... but there's still quite a bit of information that I've written about it. So...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.. anyway, feel free to leave a comment if you have questions!&lt;/p&gt;

But how should we bring all of that stuff together? Well, I think I've got an idea...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, I've been doing lots to automate my home. It's come to the point that my mother and other family members complain that they
can't do anything in my house without me. Well, that's left me with a bit of a conundrum. How can I make it so that people can use the home-automation
things, but not need any of the nuianced nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All of the Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working to make the audio "network" in my home quite extensive. Between use of &lt;a href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/vban.htm"&gt;VBAN&lt;/a&gt; for digital
audio streaming between my study and living room (&lt;a href="/networked-audio-using-vban-and-rpi"&gt;read more here&lt;/a&gt;), and analog connections from my study to
kitchen, lab, and (yes) even bathroom. Now, the challenge with all that is that it's still highly reliant on my desktop or cell phone as the main source
of audio. Additionally, whenever I have virtual meetings in my study, I need to shut everything down around the house. Not very much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I need a central control to allow easy Pianobar playback control, in addition to a "master mute" button that'll disable all audio streaming
around the house. Now... I'm still working on the actual "control box" which will have all of the buttons, but the operational pannel is already set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/home-automation-center/ima_3d778f5.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Audio Output Blocks"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my analog stream is in stereo, I - of course - need to have four sets of terminals to make wiring easy. That's what's shown in the above picture;
there's one for +R, -R, +L, and -L. Everything we need! They all connect to an input block by way of an ESP-8266 relay-breakout-board (shown in the upper-right
of the image below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/home-automation-center/ima_eec766f.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Audio Connector Control"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get this set up (completely) the little ESP board will listen for &lt;a href="https://mqtt.org/"&gt;MQTT&lt;/a&gt; commands from my home-automation server that will tell it
to open the normally-closed relay contacts and effectively shut down the whole analog audio network by disconnecting my study mixer from the rest of the
house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detecting Doorbell Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my house, the doorbell is a bit difficult to hear from anywhere other than the livingroom. I mean, it's possible to hear it from around the house, but not
always. When I'm in the kitchen, if I'm cooking (which is often what I'm doing when I'm waiting for the doorbell), I can't often hear the bell over my skillet!
So, I want to integrate the doorbell detection into some more intelligent operations and be able to send push notifications or even play audio chimes through
the centralized audio system. Shouldn't be difficult, but I need to interface with one of my little &lt;a href="https://www.embeddedts.com/products/TS-7500"&gt;Technologic TS7500&lt;/a&gt;
computers. Now... this computer has a 5VDC input. Not exactly ideal when the doorbell is running at about 16VAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/home-automation-center/ima_c71dcbc.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Doorbell Conditioning Circuit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, another part of my home-automation center was built up. I needed to consume the AC input, run it through a bridge rectifier (the grey square on the right),
apply a little filtering and smoothing with a "reasonably big" capacitor, and then shove that into a 12VDC relay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and why, Joe, didn't you just use an AC relay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erm... I don't really have a good answer for that other than the fact that I had all of these components on-hand, and it seemed like fun. Call me cheap for not
picking up a $4.00 relay. Go ahead! I won't argue. It is cheap. But, I already had a few things on-hand, and heck! Why not?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That relay is really only needed to use the doorbell signal to trigger the 5VDC signal to pass to the little Linux computer's input which then, in turn, can be
monitored and used for triggering all manner of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leveraging Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature that I want to add is making one of the lights in my entryway a three-way switched light. The purpose of which is reasonably self-explanatory,
but I want to bring intelligence to one of the light in my living room. The challenge is that the light is a traditional one, and it's already wired into the
wall (properly), and I'd rather have a true three-way-switch than the dumb little "hack" that I used for my dining room light (which will surely change someday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gone ahead and connected a nice, big, wiring block (shown in the upper-right of the image below) to allow for connections into the computer and the light
itself. This should make it nice and convenient, and make a true 3-way switch possible where the computer and the light switch will always be responsive to
control, and I won't have to wait for the dumb thing to boot up and initialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/home-automation-center/ima_a8b8778.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Wiring Blocks for Lights"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Technologic computer, of course, has its own relay-break-out-board which also sandwiches nicely into its fancy little aluminum case (shown below), and that
is how I'm taking control of the light. Just like any other three-way-switch, I'm using the NO/NC contacts to wire opposite those of the three way switch I'll
mount in the wall, and then I'll be able to control the light, either from a physical switch, or from the computer. Either way, no problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/home-automation-center/ima_5caf4e9.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Computer and all the Power Supplies"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also notice that there's a couple of power supplies there. I've got a nice little "computer-style" power supply which provides 5V, and I've also got
a little board that I salvaged from some old (crappy) DJ dance lights that provides 12V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and what, Joe, is the 12V supply for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you asked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talking with the Telegraph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right... I'm nerdy enough that I want to connect to an old Telegraph key, and actually &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt; with it. I'm wiring it in by my front entryway
for no other purpose than to excentuate my "nerdiness". I'm not even quite sure what the system will do, yet, but I'll come up with something cool. Maybe
listen for special "commands" and "do" respond with secret messages if you send the right code. Maybe just repeating messages back to the sender. Maybe
other things. Who knows! If you've got some fun ideas, drop a note in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;Side Note:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;----------&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;In case you weren&amp;#39;t aware (and since I still haven&amp;#39;t written a post about how I did it, you&amp;#39;re probably not aware)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;the comment system embedded here in my blog is all hosted on an old computer in my basement (one of many), and is&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;completely managed by me! So no worry about some third party service discontinuing their product. I get to keep&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;hosting it as long as I want... Go ahead! Try it out! It even supports markdown...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/home-automation-center/ima_fe0af05.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Wiring Blocks and Power Supplies"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fair to say that there's quite a bit more that I still need to do here. In fact, I've got a lot of wiring to do, still... But I'm excited that this
project which, notably, is recycling the "box" that I used for my first foray into some home autoation is coming along nicely. In fact, this box contained
the same computer and some of the same components to allow me to dabble in my first home-automation and Python web-serving application. There's still much
to be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux computer is OLD, and will only (realistically) run Debian 5, which will make updates near impossible. That means that Python is going to be
constrained to Python 2 (if I'm lucky, maybe I can load from the DeadSnakes PPA - but I'm doubtful), and that pretty much blocks the use of MQTT. That said,
I still think I can pretty effectively set up the computer to host a little web-server to have REST-API endpoints, and I think I can even get it set up to
&lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; REST-API calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to see what fun will come of this!

Well, that's even more true if you've got half a dozen servers all floating around, waiting to be used. So I think it's about time that I get some of my new servers mounted in the basement to improve the general usage of my resources!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alright, I really don't have much to say about this one, other than I've got some new servers mounted in the basement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up some new server hardware including a really nice Synology NAS, and a 2-U 64-bit computer (yeah, I get excited about that since, remember,
most of my computing hardware is ancient 32-bit stuff). I'm really excited to start setting them up as the new home for my Nextcloud service, and a nice
backup file storage server to start sharing the load of all my git backups, etc. to some rugged machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway... check it all out!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got even more computers now! Take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

That, after all, is the ethos of 4-H. The very esence of how 4-H teaches youth effective life-skills every day. This "photo upload app" that I've been working on relies on some of the newest, prettiest, fanciest web framework technologies available to make the common user-interaction experience very smooth so that youth may engage in digital activities easily, without having to learn new hoops to jump through. Still, it's being built &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; youth, &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; youth, so wouldn't it be disappointing if there weren't aspects that were clearly touched by youth? Clearly inspired by them? Sharing their energy and creativity?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Errors are a given when it comes to computers. Heck, they're a given when it comes to most technology. We're all familiar with the &lt;em&gt;"dreaded 404"&lt;/em&gt; that's
presented to users when a page or resource can't be found. That doesn't mean that they have to be boring! After all, the text "404" on screen is plain;
uninteresting. Wouldn't it be disingenuous to use just plain text for a web-service that's exciting and interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enter Youth-Designed Error Pages!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/4h-err-pages/err404.png" style="width: 100%" alt="404 Error Page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 404 page was designed by the youth that I'm working with. It gives some flavor to the site when something goes wrong. Admittedly, it's never the goal
for things &lt;em&gt;to go wrong,&lt;/em&gt; but when it (inevitably) happens, we're ready!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to introduce the 4-H member who's helping me to a little "old-fasioned" web design. Crafting plain &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; and putting it all together
for the specific purposes of showing errors, but that's not exactly &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; when you're just starting out. I also wanted to capture some of the "flare" and
creativity that 4-H members always seem to have. After all, isn't part of the fun of any development project putting in the easter eggs? I think so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that leaves me with two clear goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Youth-designed static HTML/CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing creativity of youth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said... It's not easy to just spin HTML off the cuff when you've never done any of it before in your life! Especially when we're talking about full-
fledged pages that have pretty formatting and the like. What to do... what to do...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter: Microsoft Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.redd.it/1s0rlfdtsvg61.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Ultimate IDE?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's right. The ultimate IDE... Well, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Microsoft Word may not be a good IDE by most (sane) people's standards, but that doesn't mean that we can't use it for a little visual assistance.
One thing that Word does have going for it in this space is the ability to easily format pages with text, images, formatting, and more. All in a convenient
interface. After all, isn't that the reason that most of the world uses MS Word instead of LaTeX?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this convenience, it's pretty easy to put some images together, add some text, center it how you want, and publish! Did I mention two key features?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word has an web-page viewing mode to present the page as how it might appear in a browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word natively supports saving a file as &lt;code&gt;*.htm&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;*.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that I could get anyone started with creating the pages, and worrying less about the HTML and more about how they want the pages to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bumps in the Proverbial "Information Superhighway"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's all well and good; quite simple really, but here's where the rubber hits the &lt;code&gt;10101001010010101010010101010010100010101111&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes time to publish these pages, it's pretty simple, the whole repository that we're working in is based around the separation of a frontend and
a backend. The backend houses all the Python goodness, and all of the static and template files that are rendered and loaded for web-serving. That means
that if we want to host specific files for error pages, we can split them up and distribute them accordingly into the backend directories like shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someErrPage_files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;supporting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someOtherErrPage_files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;supporting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;templates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someErrPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someOtherErrPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- main.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we "export" or save the rendered error page from Word, we end up generating a single HTML file, and a folder full of supporting files. Everything
from CSS, to XML, to images, and more. Since that's all static stuff, we can stick it in a sub-folder under the &lt;code&gt;backend/static&lt;/code&gt; directory. The plain HTML
file, on the other hand, goes to the &lt;code&gt;backend/templates&lt;/code&gt; folder where it will be pulled from by Jinja in Python and rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to all of this, is getting paths right. After all, pirates didn't find their treasure if they meant "paces" when they said "leagues" right?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In much the same way, when Word generates those files, it assumes a certain path. It assumes that the folder containing all support files is colocated with
the HTML file, in the same directory. Clearly, here, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation is for good reason though, all of the support files are static, they're not templates. We wouldn't ever want Jinja to attempt rendering
any one of them, so they go in the &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directory. Simple as that. Now, the Python server already knows to route accordingly for static files, after
all, early on, it uses a static router for FastAPI to do the lifting here, and it also sets up the templates structure accordingly so as to make Jinja
rendering easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Application Base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FastAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on_event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;startup&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;startup_event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Event that Only Runs When App is Starting&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Mount the Static File Path&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/static&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StaticFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;static&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;static&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Jinja2Templates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;templates&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice however, that for FastAPI to "catch" any such requests, it needs to see a URI with the prefix of &lt;code&gt;/static&lt;/code&gt;. Are you beginning to see the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, because MS Word doesn't include that prefix, the web-client will unknowingly ask for files that don't exist, and FastAPI will throw up its
hands in defeat. Now, that's not all bad, since they're all just plain files, we can edit the HTML quite easily, and with a tweak or two, we can add the
prefix where it's needed. It took me a bit to figure out exactly where this needed to be done, but when I did, it was very straight forward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let you be the judge here. You've already seen the 404, but here's the 501 and 503:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/4h-err-pages/err501.png" style="width: 100%" alt="404 Error Page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very satisfied with the results; they pages are clever, cute, and most of all, they're genuine and showcase the very esence of learning and exploring
with 4-H. That all makes me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/4h-err-pages/err503.png" style="width: 100%" alt="404 Error Page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Them Stand Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be able to show off these pages whenever I want. After all, it would kinda suck to only be able to see them when there's a legitimate
error. That would make it very difficult to show them to passers-by! So, we did a little function-crafting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# HTTP Error Response&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/404&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HTMLResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;503&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page501&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See here, that we were able to create three unique web-endpoints with FastAPI for each of the error pages, and then we could wrap them in the single error
handler. This means that when a user goes to &lt;code&gt;https://develop.idaho4h.com/404&lt;/code&gt; they actually see the 404 page without generating a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; 404. The same is
true for the other two errors, making the whole thing pretty slick, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess I'm tooting my own horn pretty loudly, at this point, aren't I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it's been lots of fun getting to work with youth to make these custom error pages and show them off! It really helps demonstrate the work
that this 4-H member has put in!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Youth"></category><category term="4-H"></category><category term="Education"></category><category term="Development"></category><category term="HTTP"></category><category term="HTML"></category><category term="Status-Codes"></category></entry><entry><title>What is Tasmota, Anyway?</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/what-is-tasmota-anyway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-23T22:34:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-03-23T22:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2022-03-23:/stanley-solutions-blog/what-is-tasmota-anyway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had a handfull of friends and colleagues ask about Tasmota; what it is, what it does, how to use it, etc. So I thought I'd put together a little article to tell you about this AWESOME open-source IoT firmware, why I use it, and how you can get started with it too!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/_media/frontlogo.svg" width="300" alt="Tasmota" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I've talked to you at all in the past year or so, you probably already know that I've gone a little wild with the home automation thing. I've got
all sorts of "smart stuff" scattered around the house. Mostly to turn lights on or off, but I do have some more intelligent things too. But, I'm a bit of
a tin-foil-hat-wearer, I guess you could say. After all, I run my own local Home Assistant, and to tie in nicely, I also use a free-and-open-source
firmware for most of my IoT devices, a little, something called &lt;em&gt;Tasmota&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Tasmota?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/"&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source firmware, developed for the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers manufactured by Espressif. It's a lightweight, multifunctional, and
fully featured smart-home software for nearly every IoT device you can think of. It supports both MQTT and RESTful API communications, meaning that it can tie into nearly every home automation system available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, there's a few things that I really like about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1) Its Openness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's absolutely fantastic to have such a wonderful, well developed project all floating out in the open. Tasmota started as a simple project built for
ESP8266 devices, but quickly expanded to work for just about any IoT devices that run on the Espressif chipset. All sorts of common, economical brands of
smart plugs, smart bulbs, and more are supported by Tasmota, all because they're built on the Espressif chip, and the Tasmota firmware core is open,
allowing for continued expanse and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasmota is all available on GitHub, stored in the open, improved by the many. Plenty of wonderful developers who are all working on the project, but
clearly, I'm caught up on the great utopian parts of it all, and overlooking the downsides and drawbacks of open source. But perhaps that's ok. Maybe
that's just what I need to keep the spirit, and maybe that's good for us all. I guess I'm digressing, aren't I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2) Its Feature Set&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasmota's got some awesome features, too! From it's simple, easy-to-get-started-with web interface and configuration to its integration with MQTT, and
simple HTTP REST interfaces. Even it's fully baked-in console for configuration. Tasmota has all the features that the other modern IoT devices have,
and all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3) Its Lack of Cloud Dependence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that I've got a case of "tin-foil-hat-itis"? Well, it's a problem. Perhaps not such a "problem" but it does mean that most of my smart
things don't talk to the rest of the world. That does mean that I can't exactly take direct control of all of my home automation when I'm not at home,
but I think I like it that way. A little security, of sorts...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having no reliance on the wild inter-webs, it means that when things go down (like my connection to the internet), I still have control of all my things.
Well, until I break things (as per the usual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of open source (clearly) and if you're ever looking to make your home a little smarter, let me recommend you take a look at Tasmota!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="IoT"></category><category term="Tasmota"></category><category term="IOT"></category><category term="Smart-Home"></category><category term="Open-Source"></category><category term="ESP8266"></category><category term="ESP32"></category><category term="Home-Automation"></category><category term="Wifi"></category></entry><entry><title>Automagic Test Websites</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/automagic-test-websites.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-22T18:32:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-03-23T14:49:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2022-03-22:/stanley-solutions-blog/automagic-test-websites.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I've been working with a 4-H member to develop and build a smart, simple, and elegant web-application for 4-H members to upload photos they take while participating in a youth conference.

&lt;p&gt;What I am here to talk about is how I'm making it automatically deploy the application for
&lt;a href="https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/idaho4h/4HPhotoUploader"&gt;each development branch in my GitLab instance&lt;/a&gt; automatically with a little Jenkins magic.
You see, since I have a personal Jenkins instance set up to work with my GitLab, it's able to authenticate and pull all of the source-code from any branch
in whichever repository I configure. Better yet, I can make it automatically look for changes to any-and-all branches, and automatically run builds when
those branches change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've just described is nothing new to those who work in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) systems, but it is valuable and, I think,
novel in this context. I'm using this automated build system to abstract the complexity of deploying a containerized application so that I can focus on
development with a youth member, and focus on programming, not deploying servers. Using Jenkins, in this way, the 4-H'er that I'm working with can write
his own code in GitLab's built in editor, so he doesn't need to learn &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and he can commit his work, and watch it automatically deploy for him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I'm Making the Magic Happen with Jenkins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... Like I said, Jenkins is doing most of the heavy lifting here. It's looking for changes, then running builds when those changes appear; but Jenkins
isn't the &lt;em&gt;hosting server&lt;/em&gt;, itself, it's just the CI server. In fact, I'm using a Linode server which is configured and provisioned as a Jenkins agent (as
far as my Jenkins instance is concerned) that has NGINX, Python, Docker, and docker-compose installed to do the heavy lifting. This way, I can make it all
come together quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline, in a nutshell, looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/jenkins_4h_deployment.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Jenkins Pipeline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's walk through those stages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1) Prep&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much what it sounds like. Pull down the repo source, do any other setup that's necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably though, this stage actually URL-ifies the branch name. In other words, it sanitizes the branch-name to make it appropriate for a unique
subdomain-name. This is kinda critical. Each branch will end up getting its own subdomain under the &lt;code&gt;idaho4h.com&lt;/code&gt; domain that's filed for this server.
The process is pretty simple, really, just replace whitespace and slashes with dashes so that it's a "legal" subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the function I use to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;urlifyBranchName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;quot;Sanitize&amp;quot; the Branch Name as a Sub-Domain Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// i.e., https://&amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;.idaho4h.com/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2) Test Python&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one's pretty simple. Since Python is holding up the backend, I want to run some tests. This is pretty much unit-test only (no functional or
integration tests, here - yet), but it allows us to check some of the simple sanitizer functions we're going to count on for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adittedly, I had a bit of trouble with some of the virtual-environment stuff, and haven't gotten back around to fixing that yet, so for now just ignore
the title of the function. The execution is pretty simple. pip-install the requirements we need, then run &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;runPythonTestsInVirtualEnv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Test Python&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Install Requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;python3 -m pip install -r ${WORKSPACE}/${requirementsFile}&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Run `pytest`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pytest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3) Build the Frontend&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole project relies on a Python backend, and a React.js frontend. I need to get around to documenting this whole intertie a little better, but for
now, just know that there are two root folders. One for the frontend, the other for the backend. When building the whole thing, we build and export the
frontend and shove it into the static folder of the backend. Python can then serve all of the javascript, html, and css files from there. Pretty simple,
really (took a while to figure out, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this stage does can be summarized as follows: install npm resources, fix what audit warnings can be handled, build the artifacts. Fairly simple!
Again though, I'll note that there is some prior setup required to make the whole npm ecosystem "happy" with the structure of the frontend folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;buildReactFrontend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;React Frontend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;frontend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Ensure all Packages are Installed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm install&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Attempt to Resolve Reported Vulnerabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm audit fix || true&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Don&amp;#39;t fail on normal warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use the Build Tooling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm run build&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4) Dockerize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole thing runs in a little docker container. Pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Dockerfile for Idaho 4-H Photo Upload Service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;python:3.9&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/server&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;./backend /server

&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /server/requirements.txt

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Run Server on localhost:8383 so Nginx can Hit it without Direct Extern. Access&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;uvicorn&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;main:app&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;--host&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;0.0.0.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;--port&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;80&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;--log-config&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;log_conf.yml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we just dockerize the Python application after pulling all of its backend source contents into one spot. This whole container is then built and
deployed with a little docker-compose magic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;3.9&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Web-UI is Defined by Local &amp;quot;Dockerfile&amp;quot;, Must Be Rebuilt Each Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;webui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;./Dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;$NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT:80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;$RESTART_POLICY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;LYCHEE_API_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;LYCHEE_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the use of a few things, we've got several environment variables in that docker-compose file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/code&gt; Defines the port that should be used on the host system such that NGINX may pass it traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RESTART_POLICY&lt;/code&gt; Defines whether or not the container should restart automatically, this is only set for the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LYCHEE_API_USER&lt;/code&gt; Calls out that a local environment variable should be pulled from Jenkins to declare the username to use for Lychee access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LYCHEE_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; As for the username, calls out reference to what Jenkins provides as the password (token) for the API access to Lychee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is all leveraged in Jenkins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;buildDockerContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Docker Container&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Check for &amp;quot;Default&amp;quot; Conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// MAIN and DEVELOP Branches Should Have Consistent Ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Their Containers Should Also Restart Automatically&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DOCKER_BRANCH_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;8000&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Build the Container - Using the Branch-Name as Env Var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;docker-compose up -d --build&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins scripting is responsible for doing a few things. First and foremost, if the branch is one of the "static" branches (&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;),
it's given a static port (the same as the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; time this branch was deployed). If it's not one of the key branches, then it's given the next available
port, one that comes from a file on the host OS and is incremented each time there's a new deployment. Admittedly, this is a bit intense, and it makes
the port move a little more than it probably needs to, but it does ensure somewhat robust port management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the port number is being decided, the restart-policy may be updated. You see, the default restart policy is &lt;code&gt;"no"&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the
container should NOT restart if it were to fail, or the host OS were to restart; however, that's not the behavior we want for the "static" branches. They
should restart whenever possible! And that's exactly what the &lt;code&gt;RESTART_POLICY&lt;/code&gt; environmental override does. It updates the restart policy fro &lt;code&gt;"no"&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;"always"&lt;/code&gt; for the static branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next piece of the script is to run the docker-compose command, but notice how that's done in the context of a &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; block. This allows
Jenkins to provision the Lyche credentials to environmental variables that docker-compose can reference and inject into the container at build-time. This
gives us the ability to launch the container with the appropriate credentials, while securing them in Jenkins and avoiding the need to have them stored as
a static file either in GitLab, or on the server, itself. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5) Deploy in NGINX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who likes typing in the specific port for the web-service they want to use... or better yet, besides the nerdier of us who know about it... who would even think of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly where NGINX comes in in this case. NGINX does all of the proxying for me on this server. What's a proxy? you ask. Well, according to
the Merriam-Webster dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;proxy (noun)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\ ˈpräk-sē  \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the agency, function, or office of a deputy who acts as a substitute for another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, NGINX &lt;em&gt;proxies&lt;/em&gt; or represents each of the various services and, in turn, passes web requests to them. So for each new branch, I need to create a new proxy for the associated, url-ified branch name to pass to the specific application port that the container is listening on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's done pretty simply by running a little Python script to generate the NGINX configuration, then we restart NGINX to accept the new config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;deployContainerInNginx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Deploy in NGINX&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Generate the NGINX Config File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;python3 ./writeNginxConfig.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Restart NGINX To Apply Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;sudo /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That little Python script helps us out too, it basically sucks in a few of the environmental variables to determine how the configuration should be written
(or if it should be written at all - it's not written for &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branches). After slurping up those environmental variables, it writes out a
new file with the configuration into NGINX's sites-enabled directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;deployNginx.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;A deployment helper script to automate the addition of new NGINX configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;files in the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;PORT_VAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6) Wrap Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much exactly what it sounds like, this final stage just puts things "away" after the fact. The primary purpose of this operation is just to store
the configuration for the TCP port to use for Docker the next time around. It's all simplified with the use of a Python file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;################################################################################&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;PORT_VAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;NEXT_AVAIL_APP_PORT&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Validate that this is not one of the &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; cases&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Run `pytest`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pytest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we spend MORE time on learning, and LESS time on fighting the system! In theory, at least...&lt;/p&gt;

It's been a while since I've been very involved in swine projects in 4-H, but it's been good getting back into the swing of things. Admmittedly, I'm learning new things all the time, myself, but since the ethos of 4-H is "Learn by Doing," I'm always one for good, tangible, hands-on exercises to help engage youth while teaching. I thought it about time that I share a few of my ideas!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm just getting back into the swing of 4-H activities. Monthly community meetings, regular project meetings, etc. But I want to bring some exciting new
learning activities to the projects I'm supporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent... gosh... 10(?) years in the swine project, about 8 of which were both in market and breeding projects, so quite a bit of time around those pigs!
Well worth it, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm getting started with leading, I've been starting to amass some of the ideas I've had for learning exercise. Some are borrowed, and some are of my
own creation. This article will chronicle some of those ideas; both the good, and the... interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Bad Water”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/18/85/23/360_F_118852383_kjyToVFqvQ9T1rNlfrYQuYiAlmtqZTU9.jpg"
    width="300" alt="Dirty Water" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;image credit: &lt;a href="https://stock.adobe.com/hu/search/images?k=dirty+water+glass"&gt;Adobe Stock Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I can't claim that this was my idea (thanks, Roxanne!); but I'll shamelessly use it, because... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean water is essential! Most of us know this, and some of us have first-hand experience with the alternatives and their repercussions, but it's very
important to instill this &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; in youth who are raising livestock (not just pigs). I think most of the reasons are pretty self-expanitory, but I'll
list some of them, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hogs who don't have access to clean water...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...are often unhealthy, prone to disease; if not because of pathogens in the water, because of lack of hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...rarely gain weight optimally. Their bodies are too preoccupied with surviving to pack on muscle the way we want them to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...can become aggressive over clean water, or become lethargic, not getting the exercise they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the exercise that Roxanne so graciously provided me brings together Sprite, and soda-water. One is pretty universally enjoyed by young people, the
other almost the opposite. Fill so many cups that each 4-H'er can have a cup to themselves, splitting the pour right down the middle. Half the cups get
Sprite, the other half get soda-water. Be sure not to over-fill the cups so that the kiddos will need to pee too quickly. Tell all of the kids that you've
got some "soda" that they can drink, but don't tell them that some are better than the others. Let them all take a cup and have a drink. After you get the
usual "grumblings" and complaints, offer the kids more if they'd like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the kids who had Sprite will likely get more, the others may, or may not. It's probably a good time to ask the kids who &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; didn't
like their drinks what they didn't like about it. This all, of course, leads right in to a perfect opportunity for you to talk about the importance of
fresh, clean clean water, and how having anything other than good clean water will likely make pigs less likely to drink anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty fun, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Withdrawl Period”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, admittedly, this one's still in the incubator... gonna have to work on the scheme a little more still before it's where I want it. But here's the
general idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, livestock medications have what's known as a "withdrawl period;" a length of time after which the animal should not be harvested for
risk of the medication still being present in their system and likely in their meat. In general, it's considered &lt;em&gt;unwise&lt;/em&gt; to eat meat which still has
any measurable level of medicine. This is important for 4-H youth to understand, because they're responsible for the care of their animal right up to its
harvest, which means that if they were to administer medicine to the animal within the withdrawl period, they could be contaminating the animal's meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The withdrawl period is brought up a few times throughout the year, and my idea is to show the kiddos how to experience it, first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said... still needs some work, but the idea basically surrounds Asparagus. Yep, that's right. You might already be two steps ahead of me here, but
if you're not quite with me yet, let me remind you of that one-so-ever-fascinating-trait of Asparagus; after you eat enough of it, when you pee, you can smell it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. I went there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, we're dealing with kids, here! That stuff is funny, and it can have a big impact! Imagine being a kid and having somme kind of Asparagus-based treat one day when you hear about "Withdral Periods," and then remembering it when you go to pee the next! Talk about a first-hand lesson!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Worms and Nutrition”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok... so this one could be viewed as a bit... unorthodox. Anywho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parasites are always a problem with livestock, and it's important to deworm animals somewhat regularly. Especially when you're trying to help those
animals acheive certain growth rates! A lot of people who raise hogs don't worm them for one reason or another. Some because it's introducing "yet
another manmade thing into the pigs," some becuase it can be difficult, and others because it's either cost prohibitive or they merely don't want to
pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it's important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what if we showed the kids just how much those "worms" can actually eat up from the nutritional input that our hogs digest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is essentially to have two glasses of colored water filled to the same level. Then, demonstrate the difference between a young worm and an adult
one by showing how much each would eat if the way they ate was to absorb water. Take a Q-tip (representing the young worm) and dip it in one glass and let
it sit there for a bit. Take it out and demonstrate that it absorbed a little of the "nutrients" but not very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've shown them the "young" worm, bring out a super-ultra-mega-absorbant tampon. You read that correctly. I think that some folks might find this
a bit... odd, but I think it would provide a good teaching opportunity. Anyway... Take out that &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; tampon, pull it out of its packaging and place it in
the second glass. Let it soak up the "nutrients" for a little bit, then pull it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After both "worms" have been removed, have the kids get close and examine the difference in how much of the "nutrients" have been taken away from the pig.
The pig who received wormer, and only has young worms still has lots of nutrients for themselves. The pig who &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; receive wormer doesn't have quite
the same luxury, they've lost a substantial ammount of nutrition, because the worm "ate" it all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Mold Growth and Clean Feed”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5f4d18f6bb023d54b55e4e19/master/pass/Science_penicillum_922527614.jpg"
    width="300" alt="Dirty Water" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;image credit: &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grim-reality-reopening-more-mold-offices-schools-houses/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many 4-H'ers will buy feed in bulk at the beginning of the season so that they can take it at lower cost. This often means one &lt;em&gt;GREAT BIG&lt;/em&gt; sack of feed
sitting around all summer, which may not be the best option... Why? you ask... Well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When feed is left to sit for long periods of time, it regularly absorbs moisture, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but with moisture often comes mold.
The longer that feed sits, the more moisture it will gradually absorb, and as it absorbs more moisture, it will begin to break down, creating additional
heat, and making a terrific environment to support the growth of mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know anyone who &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; mold? Me neither. And pigs don't either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like us, pigs can tolerate small ammounts of mold if they eat it accidentally; but they they don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; it! It doesn't &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; good! It's not good
&lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this last "experiment" I want to demonstrate is the progression of a person's plate of food over a month. It's a hands-on activity where the kids help
me fill my plate with food, and I can stick it in a refrigerator for the period of one month to bring it back and show them later. At the same time, I'll
store some pig food in a warm, moist place where it can naturally grow mold. I'll take photos of it every day so that I can make a time-lapse video of its
moldy progression, then with the kids, we can look at all the &lt;em&gt;gross mold!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I'm weird. It's ok, you don't need to remind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What'll be fun about this exercise, though is that the kids will see first hand how just keeping food for long periods of time can let it grow mold, and
how it really doesn't take much for it to happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I think I had some other ideas too... but I've forgotten them. At least I wrote them down on a piece of paper at home! Will have to go look at
those later and report back!&lt;/p&gt;

I've pretty much covered all of the things that can be automated with little smart plugs. Everything from my scentsy's to my lamps, but now,
I need to automate some of the more... challenging things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a couple months ago with my coffee nook. I added a couple lights under the cabinet and hooked them up to a custom board, using an ESP-01S
to do my heavy lifting. I ran into a whole SLEW of issues with this. Drat! Everything from conflicting WiFi signals with my dual access points, to
blown out ESP modules, to faulty board designs. That's right, I incorrectly designed the board the first time around. &lt;em&gt;give me a dope-slap for that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out I'd left two pins on the ESP module floating (i.e., not connected to any power source or other electrical element), and they very much
needed to be connected to the Vcc node with a pull-up resistor. Should've looked more closely at those reference circuits the first time through.
Anyway, I've gotten that working now! Only took me two board-revs to get it done. Hah! We won't talk about the fact that the footprint of the board
as a whole isn't quite right... Another day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really do need to share my learning from that project, don't I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I digress...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yesterday I finally wrapped up the project of adding smart control to some new lights for the shadow-boxes in my living room. I use some old
wooden crates for shadow boxes. They go very well with the rest of my "old stuff" around the house, and now they have even more character!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a set of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LMSYUP4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1"&gt;under cabinet LED lights&lt;/a&gt;
from Amazon, and some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FEOB4EI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1"&gt;12V DC supplies&lt;/a&gt;, combining
those with my little generic board, I was able to make some nice little controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/shadow-box-lights/ima_906029b.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Imagination in a Box!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did struggle a bit with picking the right N-MOS transistor for controlling the LEDs. My go-to is a BUZ11A, which is normally good enough. It's
rugged, general-purpose, and packs a punch for current control ability. Trouble is, that with my boards, the voltages weren't quite right. I
discovered this late yesterday afternoon when powering up the little board and flipping the WiFi-enabled "on-switch", and the LEDs barely
illuminated enough to see a dim glow. Not ideal for a shadow box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scratched my head for a bit, and realized that the transistor's voltage thresholds weren't where I wanted them. Luckily enough, I had some options!
I dug around in my hoarder-size-stash of electronics and found a set of logic-level transistors which were better suited for the job. Still being
N-MOS, they were exactly what I needed. A bit of solder-wick later, I had my new transistors replaced, and my lights were working like a charm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/shadow-box-lights/ima_5049e25.jpeg" style="width: 100%" alt="Illuminating my Imagination"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now mind you, this isn't a story of all up-and-up success. This is the... third whack at the design. I started with some 4.5V supplies. Those were
ample for the control circuit, but not for the LEDs themselves (since they're rated for closer to 12V). I then thought I'd get clever and use a
boost converter to do my dirty work so I could leave the rest of the circuitry intact. Didn't I learn anywhere that it's tricky to use a boost
converter coming off a PWM-enabled circuit? Guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, both of those "adventures" were a bit less than ideal; but we got there! Third time's the charm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Don't forget the kitchen!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok... Ok... I've also been working on illuminating the kitchen. I &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; need to sit down and tell you about what I've been doing with that
coffee nook light. Those are some "fun" stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had tried my hand at flashing Tasmota on some off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled smart LED controls. That failed pretty miserably. But those
controls were cheap, and I wasn't impressed anyway. I spent some serious time Googling around, and stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://www.athom.tech/"&gt;ATHOM&lt;/a&gt;
which produces pre-flashed Tasmota/ESPHome/WLED-enabled boards in enclosures designed for makers and tinkerers like me! From browsing their
website, it's clear that English is not their first language, but I'm solidly impressed by their hardware. Simple, effective, and in clean packaging.
They worked great, right out of the box, and I didn't have to fight those dumb boards that don't already come with Tasmota flashed. MARVELOUS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... I went crazy with installing these things all over my kitchen for above and below each of the cabinets... Just take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's basically the "orange" shade that Home-Assistant sets them with. But wow... when you come visit, remind me, and I'll show you the vibrance
of the blues, greens, and reds... it's stunning!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Home-Improvement"></category><category term="ESP8266"></category><category term="Tasmota"></category><category term="Smart-Home"></category><category term="Home-Assistant"></category><category term="MQTT"></category><category term="IOT"></category><category term="Lighting"></category><category term="Lights"></category><category term="Development"></category></entry><entry><title>Sensing Fire in a World Without Water</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/sensing-fire-in-a-world-without-water.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-15T18:41:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-15T18:41:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2022-02-15:/stanley-solutions-blog/sensing-fire-in-a-world-without-water.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The world we live in is congested with controversy; left-vs-right, masks-vs-maskless, us-vs-them. So many arguments, one thing that we don't need to argue about is that there are parts of the U.S. that don't have much access to water, and that there are parts of the U.S. that also face some real challenges with wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wildfire, water-shortages, weird-weather; all sounds like some dystopian sci-fi novel, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scary that some of that is appearing across the United States, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Now, weather you're a "climate change subscriber," or not, I think there's a lot to be said about the challenges the world faces.
If for nothing else, we've got to figure out where to get all that water from, and we need to figure out what we're going to do to help
face the challenges of wildfire in our increasingly populous world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written in the past about some of the project work that I'm sponsoring at the University of Idaho, and I wanted to highlight that
briefly while also pointing out some interesting things popping up from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's Happening with Water?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don't have much to say here, but I did want to highlight an article that shows some of the drama of the water shortages that
are appearing across the American Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archives.stanleysolutionsnw.com/archive/1644980067.3444/www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/us-megadrought-worst-least-1200-years-researchers-say-rcna16202.html"&gt;Read the article (archived in my personal archive server)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes me wish there were other ways I could get involved in researching additional technology in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's New&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year is my second year acting as the sponsor for a wildfire detection system, and I have to say, I'm stoked. This is a very
exciting project, and has a lot of potential. If you want to read more about the concept or tech, go check out my articles on
&lt;a href="/finding-fire-and-making-it.html"&gt;finding fire and making it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/hearing-fires-while-seeing-smoke"&gt;hearing fires while seeing smoke&lt;/a&gt;,
or &lt;a href="/detectinf-fires-with-sound"&gt;detecting fires with sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's new and exciting right now, is the team's approach, using inspiration from Mother Nature. They're using some designs for their
drop-payload which were inspired by a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_%28fruit%29"&gt;Samara leaf&lt;/a&gt; so they can make the payload
drop in a safe, and controlled fashion. Now, this isn't exactly a novel idea, there's a few others who have done similar things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/08/07/helicopter-seed-robot-can-also-drop-like-a-rock/"&gt;HELICOPTER SEED ROBOT CAN ALSO DROP LIKE A ROCK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20045-spinning-seeds-inspire-single-bladed-helicopters/"&gt;SPINNING SEEDS INSPIRE SINGLE-BLADED HELICOPTERS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this is brand new to us, and so far as I'm aware, it's a new way to drop materials as a deployment technique. I'm very proud of
the team's work, and I'm so excited to see where they'll take this project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I'll be keeping more updates coming; but let's be honest, I'm in charge of the updates, so they might be a bit sparse, or even
a bit all-over-the-place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Capstone"></category><category term="Capstone"></category><category term="Students"></category><category term="University"></category><category term="Research"></category><category term="University Of Idaho"></category><category term="Wildfire"></category><category term="Infrasound"></category></entry><entry><title>Using Python to Provide Simple Photo Connections for Youth</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/using-python-to-provide-simple-photo-connections-for-youth.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-13T20:44:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-15T20:17:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2022-02-13:/stanley-solutions-blog/using-python-to-provide-simple-photo-connections-for-youth.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So if you're gonna use Python to help bring photos from youth together; how, exactly, do you do it? This article will look at how we're using Lychee, Python, FastAPI, and React.js to make an ultra-simple, highly effective photo upload service for a youth conference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've been keeping tabs on what I've been up to lately, you might know that I've been slowly getting back into 4-H
involvement. Namely, I'm now a certified volunteer in Idaho, and I'm starting to dip my toes into leading projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I shared &lt;a href="/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html"&gt;how I'm working with youth to create an app in Python and React.js&lt;/a&gt;
and how I'm excited to be working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; some of the youth to develop the app. We're working to use some of the "latest and
greatest" technology to ensure that the service is not only forward-looking, but helps to teach forward-looking practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article though, I want to talk a bit more about the technical details about what we're doing, and how it's working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let's talk program organization...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole program is structured around Lychee as the "database". Since Lychee provides a beautiful, functional API,
and an easily maintained container-based database and storage, we can use it as the core of the service. Lychee
provides simple, but powerful album organization, and that's all available through the API (excellent!!!). Since
the entire goal is to provide a simple way to organize photos according to the "district" that submits them, we'll
be able to use the API to poke those photos into just the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be the responsibility of our Python back-end (using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pychee/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pychee&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to make the
connection between the React front-end and the Lychee service itself. This same Python back-end will serve the
React public files. Effectively, like so many other places I use Python, it acts as the all-important glue in this
system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The React front end is basically passive in this configuration, by that, I mean there's no Javascript/Node.js
server configuration on the box. It's all built and exported to static files that Python serves as needed to
"pull up" the site. Once the site is loaded, the React.js front-end just hits the appropriate API endpoints on
the Python side which, in turn, causes the Python service to access the appropriate API endpoints on the Lychee
service using a specific API credential-set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more going on in the automated build system that helps me work with youth to deploy the site in
the various stages of development so that the youth don't have to learn all of the intricacies of Node.js'
awful dependency stack. That said, I'll have to write more (hopefully soon) on how we tied my personal Jenkins
service with the Linode that this system is running on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="React.Js"></category><category term="Microservice"></category><category term="Docker"></category><category term="Lychee"></category><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Development"></category><category term="Fastapi"></category></entry><entry><title>Adding PlantUML to Pelican Without Installing Java?</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/adding-plantuml-to-pelican-without-installing-java.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-13T19:54:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-13T20:32:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2022-02-13:/stanley-solutions-blog/adding-plantuml-to-pelican-without-installing-java.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We know that I don't like to do anything that computers can do for me. We also know that I like Python, and am not a huge fan of Java. So how am I going to get PlantUML integrated into my blog without actually needing to install the Java packages? Let me show you...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently wanted to start adding &lt;a href="https://plantuml.com/"&gt;PlantUML&lt;/a&gt; drawings to my blog-posts for a variety of reasons.
Trouble is, PlantUML requires Java. My blog-site is built in GitHub actions, and adding PlantUML as some kind of CLI
utility to a GitHub action sounds... well... gross!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I've found a way around that with the help of &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/plantuml-markdown/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PlantUML-Markdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
a nice little package built to do pretty much EXACTLY what I need. It's able to shoot off the UML content to a server,
and the server hands back an image to suit my request. To demonstrate, when I use the following code-block in my markdown
article(s):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;::_uml_:: format=&amp;quot;svg&amp;quot; classes=&amp;quot;uml myDiagram&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;My super diagram placeholder&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;My super diagram&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300px&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300px&amp;quot;
   !theme spacelab
   Bob-&amp;gt;Alice : Hello!
::end-uml::
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Now the auto-rendering is SO good, that I had to add underscores around the keyword &lt;code&gt;uml&lt;/code&gt; in the example above. I'll do that
throughout this article in places where I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want the PlantUML to actually render to an image.&lt;/p&gt;

style="max-width:300px;max-height:300px" width="100%" class="uml myDiagram" alt="My super diagram placeholder" title="My super diagram" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to make all this work, I did need to make a few changes, and I couldn't find a clean, comprehensive set of documentation on this,
so I'm putting it together here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a number of things that didn't work, so let me just list those quickly to put them behind us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd tried using a tag directly in the uml-header to specify the server; later, I found that this option isn't even supported. So I
don't know what I was thinking!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;::_uml_:: format=&amp;quot;svg&amp;quot; ... server=&amp;quot;http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I then tried integrating with Pelican's PlantUML extension (which requires the Java tool be installed). I thought that I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;
need some kind of cooperation between the two extensions... Nope. Fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright... so after trying a number of packages, and combining configurations, I finally found this little note in the PlantUML-Markdown
PyPI page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you need to specify the configuration file on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;markdown_py -x plantuml_markdown -c myconfig.yml mydoc.md &amp;gt; out.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, in turn, lead me to start thinking a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If PlantUML can be generated with specific "global options" (i.e., the &lt;code&gt;-c myconfig.yml&lt;/code&gt; portion of that command), and I can specify
which extension the &lt;code&gt;Python-Markdown&lt;/code&gt; generator will run with, then I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to specify some of those configuration options
in the &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file for the Pelican site generation, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bingo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... I started browsing the inter-webs, and found
&lt;a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/10/16/fine-tuning-pelican-markdown-configuration/"&gt;this article about fine-tuning markdown config for Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
That was helpful, but left me with a few questions... So, off to the &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html"&gt;Pelican docs&lt;/a&gt; I went!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, I found that it's basically just a dictionary specifying the exact Python modules which should see certain configuration
values modified. So I did a bit of poking around to find that the &lt;code&gt;PlantUML-Markdown&lt;/code&gt; module's primary file is aptly named &lt;code&gt;plantuml_markdown.py&lt;/code&gt;
Taking the default &lt;code&gt;MARKDOWN&lt;/code&gt; configuration dictionary provided in the Pelican documentation, I did a little modification to add the
server option I needed to let &lt;code&gt;PlantUML-Markdown&lt;/code&gt; do its magic in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/stanley-solutions-blog/blob/master/pelicanconf.py"&gt;my &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MARKDOWN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;extension_configs&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;css_class&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;highlight&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;markdown.extensions.extra&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;markdown.extensions.meta&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;plantuml_markdown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;                              &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This line,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;server&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and this one,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;                                                  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and this one, were what I changed from the default.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;output_format&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;html5&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I added &lt;code&gt;plantuml-markdown&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;a href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/stanley-solutions-blog/blob/master/requires.txt"&gt;my &lt;code&gt;requires.txt&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;
so that &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; will pull it in for the rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Voila!&lt;/h6&gt;

engineering project, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Quiz Board"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a project of mine to make a &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;
and engaging public education system. I used it at the county fair to help teach folks about
swine, since that was my 4-H project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/quiz-board/22-02-08 17-02-31 1227.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Quiz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago, in a town far away, I was given an old "quiz board" to fix. It was literally a board,
and it had screws protruding from both sides. The system was simple. There were questions printed
on the left side, answers printed on the right. If you connected the provided wires using connected
alligator clips the board would tell you if you were "right" by illuminating an little bulb.
Pretty neat little idea for kids, you connect a wire on the left to select the question, then you
can connect the wire on the right to select an answer. If you were right, the bulb lights up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But it was boring!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, I thought it was. There was no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; feedback from the system if you got the answer
wrong, and it was kinda sad, for that reason. Needless to say, I wasn't satisfied. It wasn't long
after I repaired that board before I was starting to mull over ideas of how I could make my own
and improve upon the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, I was learning about how Walt Disney had used rotating "drums" with little
depressions to make practical control systems before precise timing in microcontrollers was easy
and practical. I distinctly remember an old clip from some archive of Walt giving a tour of some
of the Haunted Mansion Audio-Animatronic control systems, and showing how these big rotating drums
would depress and release valve controlls for the pneumatics. These valves would then, in turn,
operate the cylinders responsible for actually moving the animatronics around, and by coordinating
all of these depressions at just the right speed and timing, the Disney Imagineers could craft
some spectacular repeating animations. Wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked that idea, and I had NO idea how microcontrollers worked. I didn't even have an Arduino
yet, and I had never even seen real software code (needless to say, my parents were not the
biggest tech-geeks in the area). So I started mulling this over. After what must've been a few
months (really, I can't remember), an idea came to me. I realized that those little snap-action
switches have two positions, one defaulting to ON, the other defaulting to OFF; more commonly
referred to as "Normally Closed" and "Normally Open," respectively. That meant that I could use
two switches pretty easily to "route" electricity for a couple of buttons labeled "TRUE" and
"FALSE". The switch associated with the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; answer would be pressed, the other would not.
That meant that I could easily "line-up" the switches so that if the user pressed the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;
button, it would turn on a green light, and if they pressed the wrong button, it would turn on
the red light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, "The Quiz" was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/quiz-board/22-02-08 16-59-31 1225.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="The Guts"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Processing with Electro-Mechanical Logic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love touting that this machine had a 3-bit processor; which, if you stretch your imagination
a little bit, I guess that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true since it had three switches, and their positions all
mattered for the result of the question/answer. I've already explained what two of the switches
were for, but that third switch was responsible for keeping the whole thing moving in just the
right way. That's right, that last switch was responsible for controlling the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole system revolved -pun intended- around this rotating drum idea. Questions were printed
on a sheet of paper taped to a 4" diameter piece of PVC pipe, and the pipe turned to line the
questions up with a "viewing window" in the face of this gargantuan machine. When the user
pressed "start" that would deactivate the "constant" source of power for the motor, so as soon
as the next switch press happens, the motor would stop. This would, in turn, line up the
question with the viewing window, and then the user could read and respond to the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole project took my father and I much of the year to build. In all, probably between one-
and two-hundred hours, total. When it was finally completed, I got to take the machine with me
to the Clearwater County fair, and load it up with questions about pigs to help entertain and
educate the public.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Youth"></category><category term="Analog"></category><category term="Logic"></category><category term="4-H"></category><category term="Knowledge"></category><category term="Throwback"></category></entry><entry><title>React.js, Python, Pictures, and 4-H!</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-26T17:35:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-26T17:35:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2022-01-26:/stanley-solutions-blog/reactjs-python-pictures-and-4h.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you get nearly one-hundred high-school age youth to collect nearly as many photos for a competition at a youth conference? Facebook? Google-Drive? How about Python...?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you remember going to those youth conferences when you were younger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Idaho 4-H, there's an annual conference known as the
&lt;a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/extension/4h/events/stac"&gt;"State Teen Association Convention,"&lt;/a&gt; though, admittedly,
when I attended, it was known as "Teen Conference." Essentially, it's a conference focused on giving youth from
around the state the opportunity to explore what opportunities exist after high school. Youth get to spend about
four days on campus at the University of Idaho, and explore various career- and education-focused "tracks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what would a youth-conference be, without some social activities and competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idaho "STAC" has a number of social activities and competitions in addition to the educational portions to help
bring youth across the state together and help them build new connections. One of the competitions that happens
throughout the conference is what's known as "district competitions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the districts, and what are the district competitions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the state of Idaho is broken into four regional districts: Northern, Southern, Central, and Eastern. The
districts help keep some organization across the state, and at STAC, they are the dividing line(s) for youth
meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the conference the districts compete against one another for points in district competitions. After
all, who doesn't like a little good-humored, friendly competition? Now, to be honest, I don't think that there's
any specific "prize" to come out of winning, but it's a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are competitions focusing in a few key areas including creativity (photo contest, skit performances) and
healthy living (skit/dance performances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The challenge...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo competition is always an interesting challenge to host. It ends up becoming something of a technical
challenge to administer since there's no "effective" way to collect the photos into one place. In years past
all forms of systems have been used; everything from Facebook with hashtags, to public Google Drives, email, and
more... It's been a pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year something dawned on me, we could create something a little more interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we created a simple little web-app to allow the youth to upload the photos they take for the competition,
and made it a requirement for the youth to agree to a photo-consent-release. So that's what we got started on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time a few months back doing some research on what we could use for an effective photo storage system.
I wanted to use an open-source project that would allow API-based access to upload photos, and whose management
is simple, intuitive, and without too many frills. I did some poking around, and playing with different services
on a $5/month Linode (love those things for testing, by-the-way), and I finally landed on
&lt;a href="https://lycheeorg.github.io/"&gt;Lychee&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a terrific, and simple &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; configuration provided by &lt;a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-lychee"&gt;LinuxServer.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API is VERY WELL documented, and exceedingly simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's already a &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pychee/"&gt;Python Lychee client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user interface is very simple and focused without too many frills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Lychee as the "back-end storage" for this project, I can create a nice "wrapper" on the front to make an easy
web-app to allow youth delegates to upload their photos. To do that, I can use my slick little Python/React.js
integrated web-server pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to see what it's looking like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Other Perks:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty early on in this project's investigation, I met a 4-H'er who is actually learning about some programming, and
so we've been working together on developing the web-front-end interface for youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got quite a bit more fun stories to tell about how we're using my GitLab and Jenkins instances to help us keep
this project moving, but that will be coming a little later. That said, take a look at the consent form that we've built,
and the dark-mode that we were able to build!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that depends on who, (&lt;em&gt;or what&lt;/em&gt;) you're talking to. If it happens to be an SEL relay, those zeros are pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How important? Well, every byte tells a story... so that means that every zero is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where did this start?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take a few steps back. Go take a look at &lt;a href="/reading-data-with-selprotopy.html"&gt;my article introducing SELProtoPy&lt;/a&gt; to see
what the buzz is all about. In short, I want to write a full protocol client in Python for SEL Fast-Meter, and potentially branch
out from there. We'll see how far I can take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely an article that I've been wanting to write for some time, because it's very fascinating. Last year, I started
working on the project and began writing the protocol parser from specifications provided by an
&lt;a href="https://selinc.com/api/download/5026/"&gt;SEL application guide&lt;/a&gt; which describes the intricacies of the binary SEL Fast-Meter
protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I describe the challenges in too much detail, however, perhaps I should summarize SEL protocol...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about SEL protocol, we're really discussing a &lt;em&gt;suite&lt;/em&gt; of protocols which includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Meter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Operate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those "protocols" are all very closely linked, and are all intended to be "described" protocols. In other words, SEL protocol is
self-describing. It essentially defines one "main" command/response sequence which then provides the definition for each of the
various sub-protocols. SEL protocol commands all start with the hexadecimal-encoded byte &lt;code&gt;A5&lt;/code&gt;. Each command is two bytes in length,
and the "device definition" command will return a definition of all the other available commands. That is, a device wishing to
query an SEL protocol enabled device would issue the hexadecimal string: &lt;code&gt;A5 C0&lt;/code&gt; and interpret the response to determine what other
commands are available for the device. The response from the device definition command not only provides a listing of what commands
are supported, but what hexadecimal string is required to query for those commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the basics recounted, where this gets interesting comes into play when we account for the fact that SEL protocol was originally
a serial-based protocol, and made extensive use of null-padding, which is the practice of using zeros to separate content to account
for reasonable byte-alignment. That means that in almost every command response, there's a significant number of null characters (zeros)
in not only the definitions, but the data regions provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application-guide I mentioned earlier has become something of the "de facto standard" for the protocol suite, and it defines how
SEL protocol provides the numerical quantities used to describe the power system. In many cases, it's possible for those quantities
to be zero for analog measurements. Whats more, SEL protocol provides an extensive set of word-bits (boolean points) in a bit-packed
format (8 word-bits packed into a single byte).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's pause and think about that for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight boolean statuses packed into a byte; many dozens, if not hundreds, of bits packed into bytes for a single response. At least a
50/50 chance that each bit will be a 0 (false/deasserted). This all means that it's highly likely that one or more of the bytes will
be all 0's... a null-character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was working on this project, pretty early on, I found something interesting; when I would issue commands to request fast-meter
data, I'd see that the total data length was significantly shorter than what the response message indicated it should be. After
digging in, and looking at a little Wireshark, I found that my usage of Python's &lt;code&gt;telnetlib&lt;/code&gt; was effectively cutting the null
characters out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little googling, and it was further confirmed from an &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32616342/10406011"&gt;answer on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled in this same problem when trying to get data from an RS232-TCP/IP Converter using telnet - the telnetlib would suppress every 0x00 from the message. As Fredrik Johansson well answered, it is the way telnetlib was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: right"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily enough, there's a fantastic way to resolve this problem, you can actually play a few games with &lt;code&gt;telnetlib&lt;/code&gt; to monkey-patch
functionality to retain null characters. Just check out this code snippet from that StackOverflow answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telnetlib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telnetlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DONT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;WONT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NOOPT&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_process_rawq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Alteração da implementação desta função necessária pois telnetlib suprime 0x00 e \021 dos dados lidos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;buf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very interesting........&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parting Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one problem solved, but I've come across an interesting issue where sending the commands over Telnet is not
working, but sending the same commands over a plain TCP socket works without failure. Hmm... Weird. That one's
going to take some more research. I'll be sure to post what I find, when I find it!&lt;/p&gt;

This year, I'm going a little further up the chain though. I'm using wood!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;What could possibly be more fun than ripping all that Christmas paper off on December 25th?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking a box, of course!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always wanted to make one of those &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apVR5Htz0K4"&gt;useless box&lt;/a&gt;, but until I get off my laurels,
I'll have to settle for something a little more practical. You see, I created a new "lock-box" as a Christmas gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that might be a little misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box itself isn't the gift; but rather, what's inside! The box is just to make it a bit more fun, and so I guess that does end up
being part of the gift, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/lock-box/263718619_489805155698943_4659655016610554471_n.jpg" style="width: 75%" alt="Stanley Lock Box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit wild looking, don't you think? What's the point, anyway? Well, the box has two electronic locks that have to be bypassed before
it will reveal its contents. Yep, you have to crack the code if you want in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the two locks are just a combination of switches and a keypad. Set the switches in the right position, then punch in the
correct code (which is stamped on the side of the box) and the box will magically unlock and allow you to open it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/lock-box/263745955_409049780964805_407698870180682018_n.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="Do Not Open Until December 25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only two locks, it won't be &lt;em&gt;that hard&lt;/em&gt; to unlock, but I have plans to expand it. You see, I intend to give these boxes out on the
condition that they return to me. The boxes will remain "mine" for the purpose of being built up over the years. Next year, I'll add
one or two more locks, and the year after I'll do the same; so on, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ought to be a fun little tradition, and I'm hopeful that my victims... errm... recipients... will have a good time cracking the
"code".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/lock-box/263380603_595182361758282_4319520950240861117_n.jpg" style="width: 75%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, it occurs to me that I haven't provided any of the fun details! This project is all powered off a 12V SLA (sealed-lead-acid)
battery, and is run by the brains of an Arduino. The Arduino takes input from the little touch-pad, and signals to a BUZ11A transistor
that switches the solenoid responsible for &lt;em&gt;actually locking&lt;/em&gt; the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's not too much to the code, but if you'd like, it's all available in one of

Well... Something like that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok... I'm way behind on articles, so I'm gonna try to get this one out fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, or at least should be, one of many articles on the subject of my home-improvement endeavors. I know, it's bit of a tangent
from my normal tech-focused stuff, but it's still very much "me." After all, it's taking what's old, and giving it new life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my home in Potlatch in 2020, and I'm very pleased to be working on renovating so many parts of the home. It's daunting, sure;
but it's exciting to see the ol' place come back together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the big project is renovating upstairs. Downstairs was largely renovated when I bought, so upstairs is next. I'm working on
removing the old lath-and-plaster and replacing it with proper drywall. Admittedly, it's a bit spooky looking, and that's largely what
this post is intended to be about... Showing the creepy "behind the scenes" looks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Hey! Take a look there!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the stairwell and the old chimney brick for the old kitchen stove. I'm going to work on lighting that brick up and framing it out
so it'll still be visible after the remodel. After all, isn't it cool? From a bygone era!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;I've even got a helper!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look very closely, you'll see a companion who &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; he's helping. Let's not tell him, hmm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a look around the master bedroom, and a look through what will become the bedroom wall. As I write, there's now some Sheetrock
hung here, but there's more to be done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here's a look at the closet, and back out into the hallway upstairs. This helps tie a few of the previous pictures together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, any idea, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm something of a sucker for interesting research topics, and I'm incredibly thankful that there are some
wonderful students and faculty at the University of Idaho who are willing to investigate some of these exciting
ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Ideas are Being Researched?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I'm very thankful that I've been able to sponsor two different projects. A continuation project from
last year's &lt;a href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/hearing-fires-while-seeing-smoke.html"&gt;wildfire detection project&lt;/a&gt;
and a continuation of my own Capstone project, a &lt;a href="http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Biochar_Production_System"&gt;biochar reactor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... What are these wild ideas, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wildfire Detection System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfires are threatening more and more of the western United States each year, and currently, our only way to
detect fire is by sight. Namely by seeing the smoke of a growing inferno. That's often too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfire has a fascinating trait where it creates a very low rumble. It's the same audible rumble that wildlife
and livestock respond to and run away from in advance of the flames becoming wild. This sound is typically in
the range between 0~8Hz; a very low-frequency sound which is below our (human) range of hearing. But that
doesn't mean a little technology can't provide value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that's exactly where we're researching. The idea of the project is to create very small, economical devices
which can pick up this low-frequency sound and make quick determination whether sound is wild&lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt; or wild&lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;; a
clear distinction to be made! If we can make small devices that cost around &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(10-\)&lt;/span&gt;15 per unit that can do all this,
we can make hundreds, if not thousands, and distribute them from an aircraft. Then let those little buggers create
their own wireless network and report back to a central base where all of the information can triangulate regions
where the fire has appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What are the students working on this year?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's student group is working on minimizing the hardware design. Last year, the group worked on utilizing a
large development board; a unit that had more peripheral devices than were needed. Things like a dedicated power
management unit, multiple GPS units, and several radio and serial communication ports. That's not to say that last
year's team was bad, only that there's room to improve the design and reduce the circuit's footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's team is focusing on design from the microprocessor up. They're starting with the processor, and working
out what additional peripherals are needed. But they're also working on the enclosure that's needed. They've taken
inspiration from both last year's team, and a Samara leaf for the enclosure. The plan is that the leaf's natural
spinning nature will provide the basis necessary to make the design fall smoothly and without a damaging the
crucial components inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biochar Production System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochar - What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's "the poor man's activated carbon." Essentially, it's charcoal, but with some more useful properties.
There's a lot of interest in the academic and agricultural world for using biochar both in agricultural markets
and wastewater realms. There are many who are interested in the ability of biochar to act as a wastewater filter
in large scales, and there are others who are very interested in use of biochar to help act as a topsoil balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me further explain the benefits here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochar is a very porous material, since it's what's left from wood after all the other oils and gasses have been
separated from the wood. Because of this porous nature, biochar can both retain water, and allow it to move more
easily through soil. This is really interesting for farmers in regions like the Palouse where the topology flows
across rolling hills and generates a large number of both micro valleys and hills. These regions are prone to low
crop yield in both the valleys and on the tops of hills. It's all to do with water, actually. Too much water in
the valleys, and not enough on the tops of hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, biochar is very interesting because it can provide the necessary balance to help water pass through the valleys
more easily and retain the water near the tops of those hills. It's very exciting because this material might help
support our farmers to increase their yields to help feed our growing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What are the students working on this year?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team didn't complete a fully-functional biochar reactor, so this year's team is picking up where we'd left off.
They're working on getting the continuous reactor working efficiently so that we can start experimenting more
effectively. I'm very excited about some of the realizations they've made, too! They've made some excellent
observations about efficiently heating the reactor. The team introduced me to the idea of using electric heat
rather than using either a diesel or propane heater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I wasn't convinced, but they pretty clearly demonstrated the ins and outs of why it's such a good idea.
Considering the fact that a diesel heater consumed as much energy as 73 kitchen toasters, whereas the electric
heaters only uses as much energy as 3 toasters, it makes a lot of sense! The students did a terrific job in
demonstrating their findings and selling me on their proposal. In short, I'm very proud of them for their hard
work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so very excited to have these students working on these exciting projects, and I'm thrilled to have the
pleasure of sponsoring the projects. In earnest, I often feel a tinge of imposter syndrome about supporting the
projects, because I'm not ever certain that I'm qualified to support them, and I feel that I'd pull resources
away from other groups. So, I'm very thankful to be able to support these projects. I really hope that I'm able
to continue with these projects!&lt;/p&gt;

We've covered that already, but wouldn't it be exceptionally nice if I could make GitHub automate Python package releases for me? Lets do that...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh yes. I'm lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven't we established that, yet? Well, we're going to hit that nail home with this topic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've established previously that I manage a number of random Python packages, including &lt;em&gt;ElectricPy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SELProtoPy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PyCEV&lt;/em&gt;.
I've come to the realization that I need all the help I can get with releasing updates on a regular basis. So... How shall we do
that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to Start?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I needed this for &lt;em&gt;ElectricPy&lt;/em&gt; first. So let's start with figuring out what we want to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the Current ElectricPy Version from the Source Code (bail out if the version is the same or older than what's previously been released)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Tag that Matches the ElectricPy Version, then Push that to GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the Python Package as a Source-Code Bundle, and as a &lt;a href="https://pythonwheels.com"&gt;Python Wheel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the Packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are the primary requirements. Now, let's work out how we're going to do it. I know that I want to use GitHub actions to
do this whole thing. So let's start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are GitHub Actions, Anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, GitHub actions are GitHub's way of providing CI/CD systems. Essentially, providing Linux-container based workflows that are
defined through YAML description files. The YAML (which stands for Yet Another Mark-up Language) files define what container base
should be used, and what the steps need to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are there any Read-to-Go GitHub Actions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes... But, actually no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a few pretty good actions available in the community, but getting everything &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right is a bit more tricky. Why, you
ask? Well, they all completed one or two of those actions I'd outlined above, but they didn't cover the whole list. So, I decided to
glue them all together with a bit of Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start by Identifying the Version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to pick the version out of the ElectricPy package, and then we need to double-check that it's not already used, or older than
the most-up-to-date version. So I built a simple little script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Release Versioning Support Script&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;electricpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ep&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;electricpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ep&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://api.github.com/repos/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;REPO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/releases/latest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.0.0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Verify Version is Newer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_version_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Module version is not newer than previous release!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that script does a couple things for us. It polls GitHub for the latest release marked in the repo under my
username and project name. It then verifies that the version is valid and &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How About that Action Definition?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we've covered one of the four pieces we need to accomplish. What's left? Well, we still need to build the
Python package (but that's easy) and then create the release and push it to PyPI. Lucky for us, both of those
remaining "questions" there's ready-made GitHub actions! So what does this whole thing look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secrets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;PYPI_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That big definition basically does a bunch of stuff for us; I'll break it out by each of the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Python 3.10 - Because we kinda need that. Notice here that &lt;code&gt;3.10&lt;/code&gt; is in double quotes as: "3.10".
That's because otherwise, the GitHub system might mistake it as 3.1... You know, because 3.10 is really just
a decimal number with an extra 0 at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Python Script (from above) to figure out the version. But not before installing the required
packages; both for the script, and for &lt;em&gt;ElectricPy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the Artifacts - The things we want to keep. Namely the source-code distribution (&lt;code&gt;--sdist&lt;/code&gt;) and the
wheel file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the GitHub release. This will place the package on the GitHub repo's "Releases" page and add a new
tag to the repository so it's easy to back-track the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, push those artifacts to PyPI so they're available for download and install with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might not be the biggest accomplishment, but it's a huge relief because it makes automating releases
and pushing out updates MUCH easier. So, let's bring on the new features and updates!!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="Automation"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Github Actions"></category><category term="PyPI"></category></entry><entry><title>DJ Joe Playlister</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/dj-joe-playlister.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-16T12:03:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-16T12:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2021-10-16:/stanley-solutions-blog/dj-joe-playlister.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been going a bit crazy with the web-app craze lately. Let me show you what I've been up to...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working up a fever on web-apps recently. Ones that I'm developing, ones that I'm deploying, and ones that
I'm reviewing. That goes for both work and home. Gosh... I think I need a vacation. Maybe next lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, at home, my focus has been on several "DJ Joe Services," things that I can utilize for my mobile DJ work and
that will help me make those processes easier. Remember, I'm lazy! I want to find the easiest way to do things. Right
now, I've got two apps deployed, and I'll be working on a third here pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first app was an availability calendar. I'll have to write about it soon, since it was a fun project tying APIs,
Python, and React.js all into one solution. However, this is about my second app. What I call a "playlister," i.e.,
something that can slurp the playlist information out of another file/service/etc., and provide it in a more consumable
manner. Right now, it's focus is on Spotify and Apple-Music, since those are the two prominent sources that are
consistent enough for me to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/Screenshot_20211016_120952.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="DJ Joe Playlister"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mobile DJ, I often am provided "playlists" in various forms: Word documents, text
files, quickly-scribbled hand-written notes, Spotify playlists, and Apple Music playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It quickly became apparent for me, that I spent &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more time working through these
Spotify playlists and Apple Music playlists to get them into a form that was actually
helpful for me. In most cases, I could not simply copy/paste the Spotify list(s) out so
that I could search for the songs of interest in my own library and then determine whether
I'd need to aqcuire additional music. Thus... I came to the conclusion, I'd want a little
assistance from my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stages of Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally started with a simple Tkinter-app that used the &lt;a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;spotipy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
package to pull playlist information into a simple plain-text file. It was helpful, but
ended up incurring a few additional challenges of its own. The largest of which being the
fact I had to securly pass the API secrets around with the script itself. This became a
real burden, so I decided to enhance the system into a full-service mini web-app that
could be utilized for exactly this purpose. The web-app could run persistently on a server
that could hang on to those secrets and allow me to access the tool from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the &lt;code&gt;djjoeplaylister&lt;/code&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app is built on the shoulders of giants, so let me give credit to those where it's due!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Specs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I'd like to provide a special thanks and shout-out to this gist that
helped me get up and running with consuming the Apple Music playlist without dealing
with Apple's crummy developer program ($99 dolars a year, just to access an API? No
thank you!)
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/aleclol/ef9e87d0964f00975f82d5373a814447"&gt;https://gist.github.com/aleclol/ef9e87d0964f00975f82d5373a814447&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it! My little DJ Playlister! Want to go see it? &lt;a href="https://playlists.djjoeidaho.com/"&gt;Go Check it Out!&lt;/a&gt; It's not
anything too terribly special, and it's got plenty of room to grow, but it's a helpful little tool, and I think it
showcases the utility of the Python programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I mean... just think about it.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a simple little Tkinter script for which I had to lug secrets around all the time, and it was great! But
it had some significant shortcomings. Python to the rescue though, a little refactoring, and throw in some HTML, CSS,
and some more packages and I've got a full web-application. Still full Python, and it's fully-deployed! You can't do that
with a lot of other tools. Imagine if I had started with some Excel macro, or some bash script. It would've been very
difficult to scale those apps out to something that's actually useful in the context that I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not with Python!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well... Here's why!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently having a conversation with a few techie friends about the ridiculous and nerdy things that I'm doing at home. And, yes,
I realize I'm very nerdy. If that isn't clear already, go read some of my other articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my friends was curious why, exactly, I've decided to self-host so many of my services when I could easily lob those things up on
some cloud-service like &lt;a href="https://www.linode.com/unplugged"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;. It's a fair question! To my friend's point, those services are fast,
easy, and require very little maintenance (comparatively, of course). To be clear, I mean that these services manage much of the storage,
hardware constraints, and networking limitations that I'm working through regularly. There's still the regular work of updating operating
systems that needs to be managed whether the server is running locally or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't discredit these features! They're quite attractive, but there's still reason for me to keep my servers plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me explain...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point is perhaps the most important to me. I believe I've mentioned before that a lot... Let me emphasize that point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A LOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the hardware I'm using is old. Many of the computers are what could be considered "ancient" desktop towers. They're old computers doing
modern things. In fact, at this point I think I have more 32-bit computers than I do 64-bit ones. Before you ask, yes, it's a bit painful;
but it's worthwhile. I mean, just think about it... I'm currently running seven computers that other people were ready to just throw in
the trash. That's 7 computers that didn't need to be recycled, 7 computers whose lifetime just got extended courtesy of yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, they're power-hungry, and they're not as powerful as more modern equivalents, but they're doing great things for me, and that's
something that they wouldn't be able to do otherwise. Others would more than likely just chuck them, and I think it's far more valuable to
milk those old machines for everything I can. Perhaps it's just the naive part of my personality, but I'd like to think that these little
choices have an impact in some small way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Disks, My Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As just about any self-hosting fiend would likely tell you: "my data lives on &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; disks". Point being, since I own the disks, I'm the
proprietor of the data, too! That means I don't ever have to concern myself with whether or not I can revoke control over the data. Now,
I'll grant, this certainly makes me sound a bit more like a conspiracy theorist or an "old codger". I guess I don't have any rebuttal
against that. I'll just have to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Data that's Important to Me, For My Eyes Only&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tack on to the previous point, since I own the data, I can use what I consider "private" or "privileged" data on my servers. Why?
Because I own them! I can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; where the disks that store the data reside. Now, I know this may not seem like the greatest argument, but
when it comes to the argument of security and sensitivity, isn't it really all about perception and comfort anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, why do millions of homeowners install a home-security system? Is it because they think that the system will
immediately stop thieves in the act? Wouldn't better deadbolts and barred windows provide the same level of protection? Perhaps,
but then, maybe not. I'd expect that in more cases than not, homeowners want a balance. They want features, and they want function.
They want to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; secure, and they want to enjoy their home without barred windows and dozens of deadbolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why having my "private" data on my local servers is important to me. I've been graciously granted numerous data-set samples to
test some of my other Python projects against, but that data is important to the people who gave it to me. It's the sort of data that I'm
honored to have been granted access to, and I don't really think it's appropriate to share with the rest of the world. So, I host it on
servers that live in my basement. Somewhere that lives behind &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that my solution is right for everyone, and I don't think it's the "be-all-end-all" solution that I wish it was, but it
works for me, and makes me happy! After all, if it helps me sleep well at night, isn't that worth something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diversified Service Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've heard of diversified investments, haven't you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's kinda what I'm doing with my diversified infrastructure. You see, I'm not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; self-hosting. &lt;gasp!&gt; I'm also using cloud
services (namely Linode - thanks, Linode Team!) to help me with some services, and I'm planning to spin up some others in the (relatively)
near future. Sometimes speed is important, sometimes it's not. When speed &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a concern, I try to host on Linode, since they're so
&lt;strong&gt;SUPER-FAST&lt;/strong&gt; and available, it makes sense for me. But in other cases, it doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all part of the whole "multi-cloud" paradigm anyway, though. Different providers for different applications, diversified to be more
robust. In fact, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use Linode for some off-site backups. I'm still working out my backup strategy. It's not the greatest, at the
moment, but it's coming along, and some of that is thanks to Linode's services, and the peace-of-mind they offer. Mind you, the data I'm
backing up to Linode still goes through secure tunnels, and it's not the "private" data that I was mentioning earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hands-On Learning Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last point for keeping these machines kicking around in my closets, basement, and elsewhere is because they all offer me some great
opportunities to learn! After all, if I'm going to keep these things up and running, I've got to constantly be improving, adding, reworking
and modifying to (stealing a bit from my 4-H background here) make the best better. Having these servers in my house affords me the ability
to simply plug in a USB stick, or connect a monitor if I blow up SSH so badly I can't reconnect. It means that when I botch the install, I
just start over, and when I need to copy the whole darn disk, I just pull it out and stick it in my external hard-drive bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I've learned a lot in the past year playing with these things and keeping them up. And there's still a lot more I want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's my story, and I'm sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned earlier, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone; it's a solution that fits my needs, but that may be different than what
others are interested in. Still, I'm proud of the fact that I'm running so much out of my own home, and I'm excited to keep growing with
these old computers. I'm happy that I'm able to reuse machines that would otherwise litter some landfill, and keep things running for
myself and some of the university students that I support.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="DevOps"></category><category term="Self Hosting"></category><category term="Servers"></category><category term="Computing"></category><category term="Hosting"></category><category term="Web"></category><category term="Services"></category></entry><entry><title>Just Some Thoghts on a Song</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/just-some-thoghts-on-a-song.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-23T13:58:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-16T12:35:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2021-09-23:/stanley-solutions-blog/just-some-thoghts-on-a-song.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some songs have a hidden meaning, and one song that I really enjoy has something hidden so deeply, I just love it!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.genius.com/526afafd58e01d4b67deca68f8840a80.1000x1000x1.jpg"
    width="300" alt="LANCO" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a fan of many music genres, but I most certainly grew up on country. I mean... Have you met me? I wear a cowboy hat,
for pete-sake! I really lots of music, but I'll always have a soft spot for a good country love song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definitely diverges from the other content that I often write about, but I think it's relevant. You see, one of the
modern country groups who I really enjoy is &lt;a href="https://www.lancomusic.com/"&gt;"LANCO"&lt;/a&gt;; they're more on the soulful side of
country, and their bluesy style is one that I really enjoy. Specifically, I wanted to write about one of their songs
called "Born to Love You", it's a great love song, and I want to highlight one specific piece...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second stanza, they sing of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meanin' of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least... According to Google...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that in the third line of that stanza, the words "in verse 2" are separated. But if you listen to the song, I think
that they're &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually separate, at all! Instead, I think the line is a little closer to "inverse-two".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what the H-E-double-hockey-sticks is an "inverse-two" and why is it in a love song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember back in high-school math class, how we learned about number's inverses? An &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; of a number is 1-over-that
number. In other words, a number's inverse is its fraction if you simply placed it as the denominator with 1 as the
numerator. To give a more concrete example, inverse-three is: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{3}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Likewise, inverse-two is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, inverse-two is "one-half"... Read that stanza again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it's a little more touching, isn't it? Now whether that's truly LANCO's intention, or not, I think it adds a
whole new meaning and level of sincerity to that song. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjkn7orWpeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go have a listen for yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What? There's an API for VoiceMeeter? And there's already a Python API for it? Sign me up!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I finally sucked it up and bought an Intel NUC to run as my own mini audio-server. For what purpose,
you ask? Well, so that I can have an "always on" &lt;a href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/vban.htm"&gt;VBAN&lt;/a&gt; server
where I can route audio through-out my house. From my desktop, my laptop, my mixer, my stereo.... All
over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I did run into a little trouble in the process. My little NUC is mounted nicely out of the way at my
desk in my study. It looks great, and runs great... buuuuut... There's one little problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I connect or disconnect over a Remote Desktop (RDP) connection it gets, shall we say, a little mixed
up. In fact, the VoiceMeeter audio engine falls all over itself and gets tangled up. Now, to get around
this problem, I can restart the audio engine, or the software itself. So I started looking into how to
automate the kick-in-the-pants the software needed. Mind you, I'd done this before by using Python to find
the process ID that VoiceMeeter was associated with, and kill it, restarting a moment later. But that's
boring and slow. So I did some Googling...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, VoiceMeeter has an &lt;a href="https://forum.vb-audio.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=346"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;! FANTASTIC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize that that's a C-API, and I'd much rather do my programming in Python. I don't really want
to fuss with installing GCC on my little NUC. SO... I started investigating how to wrap the C-API with
Python. It's something I'd never done before, but I figured it must be possible! Once more, I turned to
the internet wizards, and found a very &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/252473/10406011"&gt;nice little article on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;
on how to wrap a C-level DLL with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used that article and proved to myself that, YES, I can write Python code to hit the DLL. But, it
occurred to me, that maybe somebody else had already done that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Google...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EUREKA! Turns out that someone (&lt;a href="https://github.com/chvolkmann"&gt;Christian Volkmann&lt;/a&gt;, to be specific) had
already written a full API against the DLL. It's all in Python, and it's glorious! Here...
&lt;a href="https://github.com/chvolkmann/voicemeeter-remote-python"&gt;Go take a look!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all that left for me was whacking out a little script to run in the background, monitor for new RDP
connections, and restart the audio engine when the connection state changed. Here's what that looked
like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# vmeetermanager - an automated tool to keep VoiceMeeter running correctly.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;voicemeeter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Don&amp;#39;t overburden the systems&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;VoiceMeeter Hasn&amp;#39;t Started Yet...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Else Will Come?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodness, there's so many other things that I can do with this now. Imagine having a full web-based front
end that I could use to control it! That would be pretty awesome, wouldn't it? I'll really have to do
some more exploring with this!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="Audio"></category><category term="Voicemeeter"></category><category term="Api"></category><category term="Sdk"></category><category term="Mixer"></category><category term="Python"></category></entry><entry><title>Tech Podcasts Galore!</title><link href="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/tech-podcasts-galore.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-12T15:34:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-09-12T15:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Joe Stanley</name></author><id>tag:engineerjoe440.github.io,2021-09-12:/stanley-solutions-blog/tech-podcasts-galore.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone's got their new favorite podcast these days. So here, let me list all of my favorites!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been asked a lot lately what tech podcasts I listen to, so I thought I'd briefly summarize them all
right here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where should I even begin, though? Perhaps I'll start with the security side of computers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Darknet Diaries"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/Darknet_Diaries_podcast_artwork.jpg"
    width="150" alt="Darknet Diaries" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites was recommended to me by a colleague. &lt;a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is an excellent podcast covering everything in the darker side of the internet. No, don't worry... You
don't need to download a TOR browser to listen. This podcast covers everything from hackers to penetration
testers; everything in the cybersecurity space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Rhysider, the host of &lt;em&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/em&gt; covers a wide variety of stories in the tech and security
world, and yet, somehow he manages to make each story captivating for all audiences. I really do mean &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;
audiences, too. I've even had my mother and other non-techy folks listen to episodes and find some value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Security Now"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the deep-tech-intricacies of cybersecurity, Steve Gibson and
&lt;a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; digs deep into the meat-and-potatoes; or should I say,
they bytes-and-bits of the stuff. Covering everything from &lt;em&gt;Boot-Hole&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Print-Nightmare&lt;/em&gt; to the latest
in &lt;a href="https://www.wireguard.com/"&gt;Wireguard&lt;/a&gt; and new security practices for IoT devices. &lt;em&gt;Security Now&lt;/em&gt; is a
great podcast for the tech-minded and security-interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now... Perhaps I should switch gears to the more programming-focused side of the table. After all, I've got
a number of podcasts that I listen to in this arena too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Python Bytes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pythonbytes.fm/static/img/logo.png?cache_id=391cb49247369a67c4be78b27f2b3cd5"
    width="150" alt="Python Bytes" align="left"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, my favorite of the programming-pods, &lt;a href="https://pythonbytes.fm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python Bytes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covers the latest news
in the Python programming language and the areas of the tech world that Python supports. Everything from web
servers to data-science, from embedded Python to the data-center!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python Bytes&lt;/em&gt; is a little on the shorter side; at least when compared with the other podcasts I've listed so
far. Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken cover all the latest-and-greatest Python modules and techniques with at
least one guest host every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Talk Python to Me"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another podcast from Michael Kennedy (one of the hosts of the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Python Bytes&lt;/em&gt;) is
&lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talk Python to Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's a little longer than its sister podcast, and goes into
greater detail in the technology or topic of interest. Michael brings on a variety of fantastic guests, all
of which help discuss the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Test and Code"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Okken's other podcast, much like &lt;em&gt;Talk Python to Me&lt;/em&gt; is a companion podcast to &lt;em&gt;Python Bytes&lt;/em&gt;. Brian,
the author of &lt;em&gt;"Python Testing with pytest: Simple, Rapid, Effective, and Scalable"&lt;/em&gt; covers the intricacies
of testing code effectively. &lt;a href="https://testandcode.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test and Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great podcast, and is a little
on the shorter side, so it makes for quick listening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Coder Radio"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coder.show/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coder Radio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a discussion-based show talking all about "the art and business of
programming". It's often very opinionated, but let's be honest... Have you ever met a programmer who isn't?
A Jupiter Broadcasting family podcast, &lt;em&gt;Coder Radio&lt;/em&gt; talks everything from Python to Objective-C, Rust to
Ruby, GO to JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, getting into the rest of the tech-stack, we simply must talk about Linux! And here, I've got quite the
assortment of Linux podcasts... Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Linux Unplugged"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets.fireside.fm/file/fireside-images/podcasts/images/f/f31a453c-fa15-491f-8618-3f71f1d565e5/cover_small.jpg?v=3"
    width="150" alt="Linux Unplugged" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, my favorite Linux pod, &lt;a href="https://linuxunplugged.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux Unplugged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covers everything in the
community of Linux; from new technologies to community happenings. Chris Fisher and Wes Payne bring the best
of the community together and make a fantastic weekly show as part of the Jupiter Broadcasting family. Always
keeping high-energy, enthusiastic goals, and a hopeful spirit; Chris and Wes open up with the community every
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Self-Hosted"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it's not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; Linux focused, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; "Linux adjacent". &lt;a href="https://selfhosted.show/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-Hosted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is another Jupiter Broadcasting show, but it caters towards (namely) the self-hosting side of the open-source
community. Everything from Nextcloud to Plex, Wireguard to Home Assistant. This is another one of my favorite
podcasts, and thus its placement in my lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Linux Action News"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linuxactionnews.com/"&gt;LAN&lt;/a&gt;, A.K.A. Linux Action News, is a short-and-sweet weekly podcast covering
all the latest news in the Linux world. Whether you're a die-hard Linux fan-boy, or a part-time tech
enthusiast, LAN is a great place to get the latest news in the Linux landscape. Being part of the Jupiter
Broadcasting family, it sees the same level of wonderful production care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... this isn't an all encompassing list, but there just isn't time....

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've talked to me at all in the past nine months or so, you probably already know that I had the great privilege of sponsoring an Engineering
Capstone project at the University of Idaho. Now, admittedly, it's something of a selfish endeavor as I have far too many &amp;quot;fun things&amp;quot; that I'd like
to explore, and not enough time or energy to do them all. Thankfully, some good faculty members are just as excited about some of these intriguing
projects as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, though, as I sit here in North Idaho, surrounded by worsening smoke from many terrible wildfires, I'm reflecting on the project I was
so lucky to sponsor, and how excited I am for its future, and what future students will bring to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-project"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/team-firewatch.jpg" width="300" alt="Meet Team Firewatch!" align="right"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what was it? Well, the project in a nutshell was to lay the groundwork for a design of a device which will detect wildfire using infrasonic sound;
that's the sound that's lower than what we can hear - think that death rumble from that old beater car you drove in high-school. No? Just me? Oh...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrasonic sound would be detected by an ultra-economical (yeah, cheap) condenser microphone and amplified before being measured by a small
microcontroller responsible for wrapping that data up into a message sent over-the-air back to some central base. But what's to make it more interesting,
this wireless message is to be sent over a mesh network of these devices. Think hundreds... no, thousands of these little devices scattered around the
forest, all taking readings at specific intervals and relaying that information back to us so we can &lt;em&gt;hear&lt;/em&gt; if there's a wildfire starting anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds familiar, it's probably because I've already &lt;a class="reference external" href="./wildfire-prevention-with-sound"&gt;told you all about it&lt;/a&gt;. This project is one that
was started a few years back at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://uidaho.edu/"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and was discontinued due to a lack of funding and support. Luckily
the sponsoring professor was still just as interested as I was, so we were able to pick it back up and continue down the road to developing some really
neat tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="this-year-s-team"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Year's Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this year, we had a team of some really outstanding students from a variety of backgrounds. Meridian, a mechanical engineer; Carlos, a computer
scientist; and two electrical engineers, Cory and Drew. We had the luxury of giving this fantastic team the flexibility of choosing their own path
in terms of the areas they were really interested in researching, which made for a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really impressed by these students and their willingness to work so hard on this project. They produced some really fantastic work, and I get
the pleasure of keeping it! At least... until next year, when we get some more students to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-product"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was able to design a really wonderful and unique enclosure to encapsulate their microcontroller, sensor, antenna, and amplifier circuit. They
were also able to use some clear acrylic tubing to really show off how sharp this thing looks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://images.shoutwiki.com/mindworks/thumb/5/5b/2021_infrasonic_wildfire_detector_finished_enclosure.png/800px-2021_infrasonic_wildfire_detector_finished_enclosure.png" width="500" alt="The Sensor..." align="left" style="padding:10px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm not going to go too-deep into the technical specs of this thing, partly because I don't want to type it all out, and partly because the team
has already done such a fantastic job documenting it both in their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Infrasonic_Wildfire_Detector"&gt;Wiki page&lt;/a&gt;
and in their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.stanleysolutionsnw.com/infrasound-detector/portfolio-2020-2021"&gt;GitLab repo&lt;/a&gt; (which is one of the services I host!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is nowhere near complete (even as cool as that enclosure looks). So I'm already lined up to sponsor a continued Capstone program again this
year (so long as the University will let me!), and I'm very excited to do so. There's certainly a few key things that we still need to work out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power - An obvious concern for any IoT device, and certainly one responsible for such a challenging environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensor Validation - This years team did a great job bootstrapping their way up, but with luck, next year's team will be able to refine that work into
something that can prove the validity of the sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless Mesh Networking - This was something that was really exciting since this year's team was able to find an open-source library to help with
this challenge, but there's more to be done; especially if the network is going to be anything larger than a few nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enclosure Testing - Anything exposed to the elements needs to be hardened, and this enclosure still needs a little refinement there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I'm really excited to see where this project continues to grow, and what this next year's group of students will be able to accomplish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've known me for any period of time, you probably already know that I grew up participating in my local 4-H program. I was a Cloverbud member
before I could be a regular member, meaning I spent about twelve years in the program. Ten of those years were spent raising hogs, and a few were
also spent participating in various leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a year as my community-club's secretary, two years as president; and I even served as vice-president and even president of my county's teen
leadership club. It was a great experience, and I learned so much about myself during all of those adventures. In my last two years as a member, I
was able to attend the Idaho state &amp;quot;Teen Conference&amp;quot; as it was called at the time. It was (and is) a statewide event held on the University of Idaho's
campus to give high-school students the opportunity to explore a college campus, learn new leadership skills, and connect with peers from around the
state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, I've had the extreme pleasure of supporting the conference (now called the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.uidaho.edu/extension/4h/events/stac"&gt;State Teen Association Convention&lt;/a&gt; - or STAC for short) as a college staff member, but this year I
was able to participate as a chaperone, and what's more, I was able to co-lead a workshop during the conference. What did I lead? Oh! A workshop covering
electricity and the electrical power grid; of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with a few colleagues from Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories to create a workshop to cover a few interesting topics about the grid. But, if
you know me, you know I much prefer hands-on exercises than any presentation. So I spent a little too much time working on creating a couple of demo
boards; seven in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-demos"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Demos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two sets of three boards, and a single stand-alone board. They were all to basically show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic circuit: generation/source, transmission, and load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overloading circuit: multiple incandescent lights and a USB charger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Breaker&amp;quot; demonstration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made three of the basic circuit, ultimately to make a point about what an electrical fault might appear as, and how repairing it might be possible. It
was basically constructed with a AA battery pack, a few spring terminals, and a single incandescent T-10 socket/bulb. With this model, we're able to
explain the basics of an energy source, energy transmission, and an energy sink (load). What made this fun, was that we could go around once the students
had their little power system running and create a &amp;quot;fault&amp;quot; by cutting the wire between the spring terminals. Then we could instruct the students to fix
their system and leave them to their own devices (and a few odd assorted materials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Basic circuit demonstration board (one of three identical models)." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203019151_490948755513699_8766751111523803463_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made three of the overloading circuit. This one was, by far, my favorite. You see, these boards are set up with 5 separately controlled T-10
sockets, each with their own ON-OFF latching pushbutton. There's also the matter of a USB phone charger connected at the &amp;quot;far end&amp;quot;. The whole thing is
powered by a single 9V battery, connected to the rest of the circuit by a single 1-ohm power resistor. This all means that as each of the incandescent
lights are turned on (being as they're all connected in parallel) the voltage across the power resistor will continue to drop. The USB charger circuit
is rated for some 6-24VDC (approximately). Meaning that when the voltage input drops below the rated minimum (6V) the supply will cease to function.
That means that the system will quite easily overload to the point of failure. This was a great example for the students, because it allowed them to
truly play with the system until they can get a sense about how the system can be &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;loaded down&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. The point here was just to share with students just
how the power system can theoretically be overloaded, and how that's not good for any of the consumers. Pretty cool to see in action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Overloading circuit demonstration board (one of three identical models)." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203656236_2868616930066285_3189504440222786790_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I built a single board (on a whim, I might add) to demonstrate how a breaker acts (effectively) as a latching switch. I used a simple ice-cube
relay to act in this capacity, and to be controlled by a few simple push-buttons. One button (red, of course, to match the electrical industry standard)
was used to &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; the breaker. One button (green -just as the red- matching the industry standard) to &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; the circuit, and finally a simple button
offset from the others, and labeled to indicate a fault. It's quite simple, really; both the fault and open switches effectively create a simple dead-short
so as to reduce the voltage across the relay coil to the point of loosing the magnetic field, and &lt;em&gt;falling&lt;/em&gt; open. However, from the student's perspective,
it all looks and feels real. It seems that the &amp;quot;breaker&amp;quot; is responding to commands to open or close, and that it responds to a fault by opening to protect
itself and the system. Lastly, I should note, there is a single blue LED in this circuit, too, just to indicate whether the circuit is energized or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Breaker circuit demo board." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203681209_804202393601180_447891412997591781_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Results:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demo boards were a pretty good success. The 4-H delegates really seemed to enjoy them, and got engaged right away with them, seemingly having great
fun playing with them. I'm very excited to say that they'll be even more useful in the hands of the SEL K-12 outreach program. My colleague will be taking
them to play even more, and hopefully continue using them for a variety of great, hands-on exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking more and more about some other activities that I might be able to &amp;quot;construct&amp;quot; in hardware to simplify the educational experience and
make them more accessible for others moving forward. One that I'm really looking towards is a simple power-system protection system. This where students
can actually make decisions to open breakers, shed load, and increase generation, all to respond to various electrical phenomena, and all actions being
accounted for by an automated system capable of making real changes to the system to show what happens after each scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little vague description, I know... But that's because I hope to actually &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; this thing, and show it off in the relatively (relatively) near
future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know, I never thought I'd spend so much time in my arm-chair. But here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's become pretty comfortable, recently, with all the new audio networking I've been working on (namely my audio network using VBAN - you can read
more about that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/spam-the-vban-for-non-stop-audio.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Still, I'm not about to just sit back and listen
without doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, c'mon! I'm an insatiable tinkerer, after all. So, I spend a lot of time working away on my laptop (really starting
to love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/"&gt;KDE Plasma!&lt;/a&gt;) and poking around at random bits and bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I need a charger, but I get bored dragging around that plain ole' wall-wart! So I thought I could do one better. I've seen plenty of those neat
looking amo-can stereos, online, but that's not quite my style. If you know me, you know I prefer cabinet stereos. No, instead I thought I could put
all of my power supply components in the can; and throw in a few of my own touches along the way. So, I decided I'd get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little too much drooling and visitation of our favorite, least-favorite A-to-Z online marketplace, I had an assortment of nerdy-looking switch
assemblies, voltage meters, and a beefy little multi-output DC power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Controls of my &amp;quot;Unique&amp;quot; Power Can" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203727287_161197975998707_4701277717982762523_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with all these neat little switches, I've got to do &lt;strong&gt;*something*&lt;/strong&gt; with them, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about adding a little Linux computer, to the mix? Sure! I gave yet another old machine new life by taking an old
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.embeddedarm.com/"&gt;Technologic computer&lt;/a&gt; and lobbing it into the case; mounted with Ethernet, serial terminal, and dual USB ports exposed
for easy access. My own sort of computer tower, you might say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mounted a Linux computer in there too!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203630587_497812148003314_6021780960392169872_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this thing's ultimately a power supply, right? So it's got to have &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;! And that, it does! Inside, I've mounted a little multi-output power supply
with 3 discrete taps; 24V, 12V, and 5V. I don't quite know what I'm going to do with 24V, yet, but the 5V and 12V are already serving my purposes to power
the little computer, a variety of lights, and perhaps a few more odds and ends as time progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The power!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/203150896_2002088606597054_7741904286201403555_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, however, is that I've also inserted several USB power hubs, and mounted a computer charger inside the can so that I can power my laptop, too!
In fact, as I sit her writing, I'm using the power supply right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'll grant that like so many of my little tinkering projects, this one is nowhere near being complete, but I will say that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the switches
does function to control the two voltage meters mounted inside (one analog, the other digital).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The final (but not finished) product!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/202866327_175178427900304_1831963921642931273_n.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="specs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specs:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about what all's in this thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="power-supplies"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power Supplies:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x 5V, 2.1A USB Chargers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x 5V, 2.4A USB Fast Chargers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x 19V, ~2A Computer Charger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x 120VAC Outlets (one internal, the other external)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x 24V DC Rail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x 12V DC Rail (powers the USB chargers, and a few other bits-and-bobs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x 5V DC Rail (powers the Technologic Linux computer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="switches"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Switches:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3x Safety Toggle Switches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5x Illuminated Rocker Switches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="meters"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Backlit AC Panel Meter, 0-150VAC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Blue LED Digital Meter, 0-200VAC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="computing-specs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Computing Specs:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Technologic 7800 ARM Computer; Runs Pre-built Debian 5.0, &amp;quot;Lenny&amp;quot; (yeah, it's old, okay?!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quick note about the project, I finally got to use my brand-new drill press for it! Woo-hoo!!! That was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, when I get the little computer tied into some more important things, I'll have more to say on the matter, but first, I've
got to get it booting Debian... Then see if I can possibly get it to run newer images... Like, I dunno, something &lt;em&gt;NEW&lt;/em&gt;?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/networked-audio-using-vban-and-rpi.html"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about how I'd started to integrate more of my house's
audio system with a networked audio protocol known as &amp;quot;VBAN&amp;quot;. I'd gotten some great
use out of the system, but I'd started running into some problems more recently...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, for some reason, if I were streaming some audio to my Raspberry Pi, and the
stream dropped into a lull (i.e. between songs, say) I'd often see some pretty nasty
buffer errors from Alsa. Now, I could've dug into it much deeper and tried to get to
the root of the problem in &lt;cite&gt;C&lt;/cite&gt;, but I didn't really feel like it. Instead, I thought
I'd just throw some Python at it! So after spending an intermittent afternoon
reminding myself how the &lt;cite&gt;subprocess&lt;/cite&gt; module works, and debugging my own madness, I
got a working script that I use as a &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# VBAN Receiver in Python&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;logFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Catch Error&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Error: alsa_write:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Failure... Python intervening!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proc_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proc_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Continue While Loop - Call Again&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# END&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that magic little Python script, I basically kick VBAN in the butt every time
that Alsa decides to be unfriendly (which happens quite regularly) by killing the
process, and then starting it right back up. With the magic of computers, this
happens very fast, and as I'd briefly mentioned earlier, it only seems to really
play into the &amp;quot;mix&amp;quot; in-between songs anyway. So after building the script, giving
it a nice little test drive, and scrutinizing my Raspberry Pi; I thought it was
time to build it back into my simple little service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# /etc/systemd/system/vbanstereorx.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# vbanstereorx.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# VBAN Receptor Stereo Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;VBAN Stereo Receptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Service]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;simple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/usr/bin/python3 /home/vbanner.py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'll be back to crack the hood back open on this one at some point, but
for now, I'm happy to stream my music back to my cabinet stereo with the power of
Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whelp, I've gone and done it. I've mounted and installed one of my SEL computers
and set it up for running Jenkins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't going to be a very in-depth article, but I wanted to say that it's
done. The server is mounted with a brand new switch and surge protector (no UPS
for the moment, but perhaps to come in the &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; near future). They're
networked back upstairs to my little IT closet, and Jenkins is waiting idly for
me to push new code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Saturday mounting the server, re-routing all the networking, and setting
up my modem to provide access to the servers by way of a reverse proxy. Perhaps
I'll document what that is and how it works, but that might be another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I got to work standing up a few &lt;cite&gt;pytest&lt;/cite&gt; projects for both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/selprotopy"&gt;selprotopy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/pycev"&gt;pycev&lt;/a&gt;, what's exciting about this though, is the fact that they're set up
now so that they can access the private resources they need for testing, but
they can be kicked off by my commits and pushes to their repositories on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... now I can really start cranking on that code, and Jenkins can do some of
my dirty work to start running the tests for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Gotta love that SEL blue!" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/IMG_0852.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to restate that I'm very excited to be using some old SEL hardware and
giving it a second lease on life. These computers are rugged, industrial
machines; and I'm getting to put them to work making these projects solid. Not
to mention that these projects are actually tailored to supporting SEL tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. It's nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. I'm still excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. You guessed it; I'll surely be giving more updates moving forward!&lt;/p&gt;

Ok! Sign me up!!!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes... I already have too many computers. But with that said, what's a few more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it was only about a month-and-a-half ago that I was writing about Jenkins
running on a Raspberry Pi, but I outgrew that pretty quickly. In reality, I
really just started with it, and basically gave up; but hey! I learned a lot in
that time. So now, I'm upgrading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-new-hardware"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am something of a hardware graveyard. Old machines come to me to live out the
end of their lives and, eventually, give up the ghost. I managed to get my hands
on some second-hand industrial computers, to do some bidding for me. Namely, I
picked up some old SEL (Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories) SEL-1102 rugged
computers. They're based on an old Intel x686 processor, and don't have anything
special in the memory arena... but they're super solid machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="SEL Rugged Computers to Run my DevOps Pipeline" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/IMG_0849.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My comment about being a &amp;quot;computer graveyard&amp;quot; might still apply to these
computers too, but well, they've got a lot more life left in them. You see,
these are ruggedized computers designed for installation into some of the most
extreme environments around the world. Rated for harsh operating conditions,
built with no moving parts (that's right, a computer without fans), and a whole
slew of serial ports (16 DB9 ports alone). SEL maintains a 10 worldwide warranty
too; but I'll grant that this warranty is void because these devices were sold
to me secondhand. I bring up this point, however because it really exemplifies
the commitment to quality that SEL brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for those of you who know me well, you'll also know that I &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; for SEL.
So yeah, I do have some bias there; but I've also gotten to see (first-hand) the
quality that we at SEL put into our products, so I'm very proud to have a few of
these machines running at home, and I'm very excited to put them into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-new-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these new servers, I'm excited to set them up running Debian (because, yeah,
they will do that - and very well, I might add) to support a Jenkins server. I
plan to use that, and expose it as my primary integration system. With Jenkins
running on these new machines, I'm going to set up a Pi Cluster to offload the
actual pipeline work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I want the main Jenkins server to be just that... the main server. I want
other machines to do all the &amp;quot;dirty work&amp;quot; for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before you get too carried away with your thoughts; yes, that does mean more
computers. I've already put in an order for a Raspberry Pi cluster, which I'm
very excited about; but that's another article for the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this excitement also stems from my need to integrate with some SEL relays
serially for testing with my SELProtoPy project. With all of those serial ports
on these computers, I'll be able to tie in to those relays quite nicely to allow
some really solid automated testing. Better yet, with all of that integration,
I'll be able to do some really nice pipelined builds for testing SELProtoPy and
PyCEV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, next on my plate is to get these machines up and running on my network so
that I can access them remotely and start integrating with GitHub actions to
fire off the builds and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very excited to be putting some SEL equipment to work in my own personal
development practices, so I'm sure I'll have some more updates as I go along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Putting some SEL Hardware to Work" src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/IMG_0850.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not, I know, but I'm not going to spend anymore time on it at the moment. See,
I've got bigger items to tackle! Namely, getting Jenkins set up on a Raspberry Pi, as
the name of this article so implies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for you; I've cut out the &amp;quot;dirty-work&amp;quot; through the magic of &amp;quot;blog-posting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the work I've been tackling for some of the other open source projects I'm
developing, I need to develop a local (on-premises) continuous integration solution to
effectively slam my code with testing and verification. After all, what's great code
without equally great tests? I need to have the system on-premises for a couple reasons;
the largest of which being the fact that I need access to custom hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, why a Pi? A Pi 3-B no less?!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's quite simple; actually. It's the only spare computer I have at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I've thoroughly introduced you, to my reasoning, and the topic at hand;
let's get into it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installing-jenkins-on-the-pi"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing Jenkins on the Pi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have GitLab set up on an old x86 laptop running Ubuntu Server 20.04, so
for this article, I'm going to focus on setting up Jenkins on a Raspberry Pi, and
getting the basics of the workflow between Jenkins and GitLab running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Start with a fresh Pi (latest build of the RaspberryPiOS). I had a Pi sitting
around with an older build of Raspbian, but that's several years old, and I
really just wanted to start fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Update the Raspberry Pi. Well, in the spirit of starting fresh, might as well
update the system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Install Java with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Verify Java Version with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; java --version
&lt;span class="go"&gt;openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.9.1+1-post-Raspbian-1deb10u2)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;OpenJDK Server VM (build 11.0.9.1+1-post-Raspbian-1deb10u2, mixed mode)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;At this point, I took some time to get the Python system up to a state that
would be a bit more useful for me. So I installed &lt;cite&gt;pip3&lt;/cite&gt;, and a number of
Python packages. I suppose this could really be done at any point during this
whole process, but I felt like this was the most sensible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Download and add the Jenkins Key with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sudo apt-key add -
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Open a new file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then add the following line and save the file to add the Jenkins repository as
a source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Next, another good &lt;cite&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/cite&gt; is in order, followed by
&lt;cite&gt;sudo apt-get install jenkins&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Using the command listed below, you can grab the initial admin password to get
started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Now it's time to navigate to &lt;cite&gt;&amp;lt;raspberry-pi-ip-address:8080&lt;/cite&gt; and use that fancy
password to log in for the first time and start the setup wizard; or should I say
butler?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &amp;quot;butler&amp;quot; has completed, it's time to get started with setting up some CI
jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preparing-a-simple-pytest-job-with-jenkins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preparing a Simple &lt;cite&gt;pytest&lt;/cite&gt; Job with Jenkins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'll caution that I this portion doesn't cover any of the GitLab/Jenkins
interfacing, maybe I'll get to writing that in another article... As part of the
material I'm skipping, I'm going to breeze right over the GitLab connection and
repository information. I'm going to focus, instead, on the build operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;With the new Jenkins server up and running, create a &amp;quot;New Item,&amp;quot; give it a
descriptive, memorable name, and set it as a &amp;quot;Freestyle Project&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Create a new project in Jenkins for CI." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/jenkins-new-config.png" style="width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;After configuring the various other settings relevant to the project (repository,
build-triggers, etc.) find the &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Build&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; section and from the &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Add build step&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;
select &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Execute shell&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;In the new &amp;quot;Command&amp;quot; field of the &amp;quot;Execute shell&amp;quot; section, insert the commands
necessary to navigate to the appropriate subdirectory and run &lt;cite&gt;pytest&lt;/cite&gt;. In my case,
my pytest &amp;quot;test folder&amp;quot; is located in the root directory, so I don't really need
to change the working directory; I just go and run &lt;cite&gt;pytest&lt;/cite&gt;. I do run a few other
generic commands just to make sure that I've got a fair report of the build
environment in case I need to go back and debug some things. So, here's a sample
of what my configuration might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;echo &amp;quot;Current Directory&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;echo &amp;quot;List Folder Structure&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;ls -a ./&amp;lt;name-of-my-python-package-folder&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;echo &amp;quot;Run pytest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;pytest -v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's a pretty rough intro into what I've been doing in Jenkins and GitLab.
Kinda rough, but I hope I'll be looking to add more in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why partly? Well, I love audio! Anymore, I don't really watch television, or movies; but I listen
to audiobooks, podcasts, music, and more all the time! I like to listen everywhere. Home, work,
while driving. EVERYWHERE. And I like to have my audio follow me around all the time. In other
words, I like having the same music in my study as what's in my living room, kitchen, bathroom,
bedroom... EVERYWHERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say that I enjoy quality HiFi audio, but I'm not the pickiest out there. My kitchen, for
example has some pretty crude audio since I bought a pretty cheap stereo reciever and just
sorta threw it together. Still, I enjoy it. It gives me audio when I'm cooking, cleaning, or just
hanging out; and for me, that's the most important part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I bought my home, I decided that I was going to install an &amp;quot;Audio Bus&amp;quot; to allow bi-directional
audio transportation. I've since started on the project, but I've run out of speaker cable, and
considering the crazy holiday spending, I've put on the brakes for the moment on my &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot;
spending. That means that I've only been able to hard-wire a connection between the kitchen and
my study. But I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/vban.htm"&gt;VB Audio Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VBAN is a UDP-based network audio streaming protocol that was developed by the same individual
who created the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm"&gt;Banana&lt;/a&gt; audio mixer which I've come to love for my desktop audio mixing desires.
It's essentially a networked audio system, allowing streaming audio transmission and reception,
and it's officially supported on Windows, Android, and iOS; and community-supported on Linux!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, it's available on Linux, and it's fully open-source as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/quiniouben/vban"&gt;vban&lt;/a&gt; where it's
accessible as a command-line-based reciever or transmitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... Late last night, after a long day of work, I decided I wasn't done programming, so I
started in on this project. I took an old Raspberry Pi that I'd already mounted in my
vintage Zenith cabinet stereo (that's a story for another day, and I'll have to tell you about
it!) and I began preparing it. Somehow, I'd ruined the SD card, so I chucked the original SD and
flashed a new one with the latest build of RaspberryOS. After I had the card flashed, I dropped
an empty file titled 'ssh' in the &lt;cite&gt;/boot&lt;/cite&gt; directory so that it would enable SSH on initial boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with SSH set up, and my new SD card plugged into the Pi, I powered it up and connected
remotely; updating the system with &lt;cite&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade -y&lt;/cite&gt; I had a
fresh install ready for my experimentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the benefit of new tinkerers interested in VBAN setup on a Pi (and a way to jog my own
terrible memory sometime in the future), I'll try to illustrate the remaining steps as best I can
remember. I had to play with some trial and error, so I'm reordering some steps to make it more
clear and straight-forward, but I'll comment on some of the &amp;quot;hardships&amp;quot; I had after we get through
all of the steps. My process was centered around the installation instructions on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/quiniouben/vban"&gt;vban&lt;/a&gt;
project README, but I did deviate a little to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;After preparing my &amp;quot;fresh install,&amp;quot; I went ahead and installed the Raspberry Pi and Alsa
headers so that they'd show up for the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo apt-get install libasound-dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;With my new headers installed, I was ready to clone the git repo and build it. I guess that at
this point, I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; mention that I'd previously installed git, but I suppose you might have
been able to infer that on your own. Anyway, I cloned the repo to my home folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; git clone https://github.com/quiniouben/vban.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Now, I moved myself into that new directory with: &lt;cite&gt;cd vban&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Before I could build the &lt;cite&gt;vban&lt;/cite&gt; system by following the instructions on the GitHub repo, I
needed to install the &lt;cite&gt;autoconf&lt;/cite&gt; tools so that the autoconfiguration scripts would function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo apt-get install autotools-dev
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; sudo apt-get install autoconf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I then went ahead and followed the installation instructions from the &lt;cite&gt;vban&lt;/cite&gt; project README,
substituting a few extra arguments to satisfy the system requirements (Alsa only, no Pulse/Jack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; ./autogen.sh
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; ./configure --enable-alsa --disable-pulseaudio --disable-jack      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Only using Alsa&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; make
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; make install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;After I got all of that working, I was able to set up my Windows desktop running Banana Mixer
to stream to my Raspberry Pi using VBAN. I configured VBAN on my desktop to stream as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Windows VBAN server configuration." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/vban_desktop.png" style="width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Then, I could simply issue the following command in my Raspberry Pi to start listening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; vban_receptor -i &amp;lt;my-desktop-ip&amp;gt; -p &lt;span class="m"&gt;6980&lt;/span&gt; -s StereoPi -d front -q &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that I'd listen for a stream of name &amp;quot;StereoPi&amp;quot; from my desktop with it's specific
IP address on port 6980. I'd then stream that audio to the &amp;quot;front&amp;quot; output in my Alsa config,
and (since this is a hard-wired Ethernet connection) I set the highest quality to reduce delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viola! I've now begun sharing audio between my desktop and the Raspberry Pi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="another-dilemma"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but we weren't done yet! See, that command is blocking, meaning that if I close my SSH
connection, say good bye to audio! Drat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that to fix this, I'd write a little systemd service, and keep it disabled, so that
I could start and stop it easily enough (so if I want to use other audio services, they won't
clash too terribly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# vbanstereorx.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# VBAN Receptor Stereo Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;VBAN Stereo Receptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Service]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;simple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/usr/local/bin/vban_receptor  -i &amp;lt;my-desktop-ip&amp;gt; -p 6980 -s StereoPi -d front -q 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then simply &amp;quot;installed&amp;quot; it with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; cp vbanstereorx.service /etc/systemd/system/vbanstereorx.service
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can just start or stop the reciever by issuing &lt;cite&gt;sudo systemctl start vbanstereorx&lt;/cite&gt; or
&lt;cite&gt;sudo systemctl stop vbanstereeorx&lt;/cite&gt;, respectively!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-other-challenges"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Other Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid it all wasn't easy-peasy, and setup smooth; there were still a few hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the biggest thing is that I believe Alsa is on its way out for the Raspberry
Pi, so I have a feeling that I'm gonna need to reform this at some point, but perhaps
that's just for the Pi4 for the time being? I'm not really sure... Anyone who might know,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:engineerjoe440&amp;#64;yahoo.com"&gt;hit me up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue that I ran into during installation was the use of autoconfig scripts and
RPi/Alsa headers. Since they weren't &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; called out as installation requisites,
I bumped into them, and had to take to Googling my way out of a corner. Wasn't bad, just
slowed me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have to save that for another post; another day. Just keep your eyes peeled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Well, why not? This time, we'll be tackling reading CEV files from SEL in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;img alt="Introducing: pycev!" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engineerjoe440/pycev/main/logo/pycev.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. That's right. I'm starting another new project. But hey! There's a lot of framework
that needs to be introduced before I can start doing all the cool high-level stuff that we
all want to see and use. I mean, by now you should understand that I'm all about getting
the framework right. If you're still not sure, go read my rant about getting the framework
right... &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/write-framework-once.html"&gt;This is my rant on getting framework right.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goal:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the plan here, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this project, &lt;cite&gt;pycev&lt;/cite&gt; (I've almost considered that it should be pronounced &amp;quot;pie-safe&amp;quot;, but
that's not how it looks, so we'll let that stew a while longer) will be a package for reading and
interpreting SEL Compressed EVent records. They're a proprietary (but open) format in which SEL
protective relays collect event information and &amp;quot;compress&amp;quot; it into a format that's easily read
by machines (computers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's already a handful of projects out in the wild for reading COMTRADE records; which, if
you're unfamiliar are &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Common Format for Transient Data Exchange&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; files, and are supported by
many SEL relays in addition to a much broader number of other vendor devices. Trouble is, not
everyone uses COMTRADE, and comparatively, CEV files are a little simpler, and (in my opinion)
more straight-forward and robust. Perhaps the best Python project for reading COMTRADE files
is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dparrini/python-comtrade"&gt;Python Comtrade&lt;/a&gt;. That project shows great maturity and value. It also sees regular updates
and bugfixes as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's such a well respected and mature project, I'd like to take it as inspiration for
&lt;cite&gt;pycev&lt;/cite&gt; and use it to help me realize the best API for the package so that the two libraries
could (potentially) be used interchangeably for various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-first"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's First?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess starting the package development is first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already carved out a repository, and I've got something of a skeleton package put together.
I think the first step will be getting enough working that I can upload it to PyPI to reserve
the namespace. Then full development will need to come. There's a good handful of things that
need to be tackled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload Project to PyPI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Core Functionality and Match API to that of &amp;quot;Python-Comtrade&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Automated Test Suite with Local Server and Various Existing CEV Files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the sort of roadmap I see before me. Now, the time-frame is still way up in the air;
so who knows whe this all will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; happen. But here's hoping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in checking in on the project, and would like to jump in and contribute,
have a little look at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/pycev"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;, and feel free to open an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/pycev/issues"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; to start a conversation!&lt;/p&gt;

Bring on the new sustainability-focused tech!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to get in the habit of writing up some brief articles more regularly to talk about
some of the more interesting articles and news that I've heard recently in the realm of
sustainability. Now, I'll grant, that I typically do my own sort of exploration(s) into
different sustainability projects and research, but I want to keep these articles focused
on what I hear is happening outside of my little pocket on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway... Here's what I've heard about new sustainability topics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recycled-concrete"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recycled Concrete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long has old concrete been a challenge for construction and demolition workers. Long has
the question arisen as: &amp;quot;So, now that we've torn it down; what do we do with it?&amp;quot; Well,
it turns out there might just be a solution! I was introduced to this brief article which
came from a scientific paper describing some research findings. You can look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201130150358.htm"&gt;recycled concrete article&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself. For me, this is most exciting since it
means that &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; amounts of waste concrete can be kept out of the landfill! Not to
mention that fewer resources may need to be used to maintain high-wear concrete surfaces
such as sidewalks for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transistors-detecting-herbicides"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transistors Detecting Herbicides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now this one is really interesting; not that concrete &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; interesting, it's just
that this one seems to fit into my area of expertise a little more (you know, electricity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201201124142.htm"&gt;herbicide sensing transistors&lt;/a&gt; describes a scientific article that details
a new technology that's still being researched that would allow specific transistors to be
immersed in water or wastewater to detect certain levels of herbicides. Why is this
important? Well, research is continuing to show that significant levels of herbicides can
be dangerous to marine life including everything from flora to fauna. Both plants and
animals can suffer from high levels of herbicides. With this emerging tech, we could see
improved water and wastewater management such that industrial facilities and municipalities
may be able to monitor their output, and make more informed decisions to adapt their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it for this go-around, but hopefully I can keep talking about some new
and emerging tech!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For any railfans, a train surrounding a Christmas tree is something of a given. But I recently
came up with a conundrum...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my house is becoming more and more of a &amp;quot;smart home,&amp;quot; and I'd like the Christmas holiday
to be much of the same. Now, that's pretty easy when it comes to the lights. Throw a smart-plug
running &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/"&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt; firmware (a free and open source alternative to the proprietary solutions) at
those lights, and let the magic commence. But for toy trains around the tree? That's a bit of a
different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why couldn't I just throw another smart plug at my toy trains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, but I don't really think that's the greatest idea. Reason being that
turning the trains on and off in a binary fashion (all or nothing) might not be great on them,
and wouldn't be the most pleasant sound either. I guess I could look at some of the solutions
that Lionel markets like their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lionel.com/brands/legacy/"&gt;Legacy&lt;/a&gt; or TMCC options, but that would mean a lot of new
purchases, research, and maybe some other annoyances that I'm just not too excited to deal with.
So, needless to say, that option's off the list too. Perhaps one of Lionel's new bluetooth
options? I guess, but that's kind of boring, don't you think? And to boot, if I were to follow
that route, I'd certainly need to buy a new locomotive, and I'd likely need to hack the remote.
Another option that I'm just not thrilled about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... well, what's left? My pickyness hasn't left me with many options, but I think there's
still &lt;em&gt;got to be something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="think-think-think"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think. Think. Think.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time thinking about my alternatives today, and well, let me just walk you through
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out thinking about the toy train transformer itself. That's all it really is, a
transformer; well, &lt;em&gt;variac&lt;/em&gt; specifically. A variac is just a variable transformer, essentially
a graphine brush that moves across the windings on the secondary side of a transformer. This
varying motion provides the variable &amp;quot;tap&amp;quot; on the transformer, and allows it to acheive a
voltage that can be varied and controlled to change the speed of the connected trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty simple really, Lionel and others pioneered this practice for the model and toy scene
nearly a century ago. Trouble is, the transformers (in my case, a Lionel ZW transformer) aren't
exactly built for modification, and like I mentioned earlier, I don't exactly idolize the thought
of tearing apart my toy train controls just to make them &amp;quot;smarter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Here's what a variac looks like..." src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91SL6j6kkNL._AC_SX425_.jpg" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time looking around for a cheap (I'd like to stay under $100 since I need to buy gifts,
too!) variac that is digitally controlled. No dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could buy a big variac and hook up a motor and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not gonna fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... well, what else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is a rheostat. For those of us who either forgot or skipped electrical machines in
college; a rheostat is basically a variable resistor. Similar to a variac, rheostats are typically
made from some form of wound wire that has a varying resistance as the user employs a sweeper to
move from one end to the other. That's really the big difference, and the reason it's not just
called a variable resistor, or even a potentiometer. Rheostats are basically &amp;quot;variable resistors
on steroids,&amp;quot; built for high-energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="And this is a rheostat..." src="https://cdn.images.fecom-media.com/A49116.jpg" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... yours truly started poking around online looking (once again) for a cheap electrical
device beefy enough to run toy trains, but not so big that it would break the bank. I bummed around
through Amazon with no luck, but after a quick search on eBay, I found something pretty enticing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess which toy train company just happened to make rheostats way back in the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right! Lionel rheostats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A Lionel rheostat!" src="https://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/SeymourAuctions/95/563895/H4246-L72135272.jpg" style="width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A solution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is that it? Just like that? Problem solved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes; but also, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lionel rheostats seem to be running about $10 and about as much in shipping on eBay at the time of
writing, so that's really good news. Not to mention the fact that they were built &lt;em&gt;specifically
for toy trains&lt;/em&gt; (score!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the fact that it's mechanical, not digital?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew you'd ask that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here, the big difference is the form factor. These rheostats are significantly easier to
interface with. Since they're linear, a single piece of all-thread-rod and a little stepper motor
could quite easily do just what I need. I could connect a little stepper motor to an ESP32/ESP8266
and hook that up to a Lionel rheostat via all-thread and a moving nut with a sweeper attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy-peasy! Well, sort-of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there's still quite a bit left on this one, and a good chance I won't actually do anything
about it this Christmas. Still, it's an exciting idea, and I'm definitely going to pursue it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, but stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, maybe I'll even throw a whistle control on there!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Now to get the controls working...&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still deep in the process of getting a fully functional SEL protocol binding suite in Python, but,
hey! At least I can write a little update on what's been going on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(if you haven't read my article on what &lt;cite&gt;selprotopy&lt;/cite&gt; is, take a look &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/sel-protocol-coming-to-python.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month of so, I've been able to really &amp;quot;whack out&amp;quot; some reasonable functionality. In
fact, I've been able to poll an SEL-351 for both digital and analog data. For those of you who
are a little familiar with SEL protocol, that means that I've been able to create a parser for
the relay definition block, and the various fast-meter blocks in addition to the DNA definition.
To boot, I've even tested (albeit breifly) on an SEL-751 and saw pretty promissing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all pretty good, but the eventual goal (well, &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; eventual goal) is to be able to poll
regularly and send commands/controls as needed. I'd also like to be able to read CEV reports
(more on that in the future) and perhaps the relay's SER (Sequential Event Recorder). So, is any
of the control functionality working yet? Not really...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten to the point where the commands &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be configured and sent correctly to the
relay, but no dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the lines, I've clearly &amp;quot;bugged&amp;quot; something up. So now, it's really just a matter
of doing some additional debugging. Hmm... will need to get started on that. Trouble is, I've got
lots of other fun projects to work on too!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="c-mon-joe-wrap-this-thing-up"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C'mon, Joe; wrap this thing up...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I'm rambling; at this point, I'm pretty excited to say that I've got some polling working
with &lt;cite&gt;selprotopy&lt;/cite&gt;, but there's clearly some more to work on. I'm hoping that I can get commands
working here pretty soon, and then I've got a handful of options as the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-could"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I could:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a system to read the SER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the CEV reading figured out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start testing on a variety of SEL relays (but this would require testing a FOSS project at SEL,
so I'm still not sure about this one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get an automated test suite built on my local GitLab instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly some more work coming, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SEL Protocol is finally coming for Python. That's right, you've heard correctly; it's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The new... `selprotopy`!" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engineerjoe440/sel-proto-py/master/logo/selprotopy.png" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what is SEL Protocol anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's a communications protocol, or standard, that was developed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://selinc.com/"&gt;SEL&lt;/a&gt; to support
fast data communications between protective electric relays (the devices that monitor the
power grid for faults) and communications processors. It was developed in the early '90s to
help improve communication support of devices to allow users to monitor protective relays
from a distance, and to perform control operations without being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've begun writing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/selprotopy"&gt;selprotopy&lt;/a&gt; which will be a protocol driver supporting SEL protocol in
Python. This means that users will be able to integrate solutions with SEL relays using
Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there's a lot to come, so this is not much more than an early announcement.
If you're interested in contributing, feel free to drop me a message! I'd love to interact!&lt;/p&gt;

And we KNOW that we can just hash out this great new thing. But where does that leave us the next time we want to do the same sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;C'mon, every developer has had that epiphany moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;I know, I can just write this thing now, and I'll have exactly what I need, and I'll
never need to touch it again; I'll never need to add more to it, and it will never
change.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish it worked that way, but let's be honest. Projects develop, add scope, change, and
sometimes, they morph into something new entirely. Actually, that's often where great code
comes from. The best projects are the butterflies of the development world. They start as
a simple little caterpillar, but at some point along the line, they change into something
far more elegant and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm writing this plea to developers out there in the &amp;quot;real world.&amp;quot; We know that
you could just write this little thing, but isn't it nice to get the &lt;em&gt;framework&lt;/em&gt; right the
first time so that when you need to revisit that code, it'll be so much easier. Or, better
yet, isn't it better to prepare the project for the &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;next guy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; who comes along to make
your framework into something incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I've devolved into rambling, as usual, but my point is this: when you spend the time
to develop the framework &lt;em&gt;the right way&lt;/em&gt; the first time, you and all of your colleagues will
thank you. It will make things just &lt;strong&gt;that much easier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a handful of experiences with this myself. I started on a couple projects at work
where I developed something that I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; was a great system, and didn't really require
a superior framework. This inevitably saved time in the short-term, but it bit me later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, I recently realized that I was re-writing the same code over, and over,
and over again every time I had to touch the code. In the end, as it seems, I didn't spend
enough time writing the framework to begin, and that hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="here-s-the-takeaway"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here's the Takeaway:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we all love just &amp;quot;pulling in&amp;quot; a library that does the &amp;quot;dirty work&amp;quot; for us.
I think it's time that we focus on getting those libraries right from the onset, so we don't
need to keep re-doing our own work, or the work of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say drop me a note in the comments, but I haven't quite gotten that set up yet. So, for
now, just keep fighting the good fight, and &lt;em&gt;write those libraries!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What about if sound were a part of it too?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm very pleased to say that I'm helping to support some really exciting research at
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://uidaho.edu"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a couple of my classmates worked on
a truly exciting project that utilized some relatively new sensory technology in conjunction
with some wireless network technology (Zigbee radios) to communicate infrasound (below the
audible range for humans) signatures back for scientists to analyze. These signatures will
inform scientists and firefighters, alike, when (and where) a wildfire has started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this was all well and good, but the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Infrasound_in_wildfire"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; lost funding. Yep. Just like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm so excited to be getting involved. We've already got a team of four fantastic
engineers. A mechanical engineer, two electrical engineers, and a computer scientist. With
luck the group will be able to start some fantastic research that could eventually lead to a
truly exciting product that may help wildland firefighters around the country (and around the
world) find fires &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; and with greater accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group is just getting started, but I'm very excited to see where things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-techy-side"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Techy Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is this supposed to work anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we've all heard stories about how animals can sense an impending natural disaster, and
in fact, that's quite true with wildfire. Most wild game (and many domesticated species too)
have much more astute hearing sense. In fact, they can hear the low-frequency sounds that
we're unable to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensors we're hoping to utilize will allow our digital system to detect the low-frequency
rumble of wild fire, then with digital signal processing, we'll aim to identify audio
signatures unique to wildfire. With this, we'll be able to detect fire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the goal will be to create a mesh-network of devices covering the forest floor in
areas such that devices will be able to communicate amongst themselves to precisely locate
the fire, and to report it to the authorities quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been investigating some new resources for high-level documentation, including
automated presentation builders, and along the way, a question arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to demonstrate code examples for IEC 61131-3, is there a way that I can provide
syntax highlighting so that readers will be able to understand the material more clearly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is syntax highlighting anyway? Well, for code snippets, syntax highlighting uses
various colors and fonts to isolate the unique keywords, operators, and other items that
are standard in that particular programming language. I'll show an example here momentarily.
This is very useful because it allows readers to quickly interpret what the code is
intentionally doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough that I was able to find a project that was already providing syntax
highlighting for IEC 61131-3 in the &lt;cite&gt;highlight.js&lt;/cite&gt; project framework (though not natively)
and thus, I could leverage existing work! Trouble is, since it's not already a native
&amp;quot;language&amp;quot; it comes with its own set of challenges. The source of this highlighter comes
from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text"&gt;GitHub highlightjs Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My challenge was identifying an effective way of declaring the language so that I could
use it with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marp-team/marpit"&gt;Marpit&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the Marp project; a system built to convert
markdown files to HTML or PPTX presentations. (Be on the lookout for an upcoming article
on this topic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much trial and tribulation, I finally realized a solution. Since I was using
&lt;cite&gt;highlight.js&lt;/cite&gt; as a required module in the marp framework, I could simply add the language
definition and register it accordingly. Here are the steps I took to modify my installation
to make it work as I wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Locate existing highlight.js installation location by finding dependent module (in my
case marp). Then open directory (since I'm using Windows, I can use
&lt;cite&gt;Explorer &amp;lt;path/to/marp/directory&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Identify the install location." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/cmd-view.png" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Navigate to the directory containing the module of interest, then navigate to the
&lt;cite&gt;node_modules/highlight.js&lt;/cite&gt; folder underneath the desired module. In my case, since
I'm using marp-cli, I navigated to
&lt;cite&gt;node_modules/&amp;#64;marp-team/marp-cli/node_modules/highlight.js/lib&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Locate the `index.js` file for modification." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/explorer-view.png" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Open the &lt;cite&gt;index.js&lt;/cite&gt; file in a text editor and add a new line to register the &lt;cite&gt;iecst&lt;/cite&gt;
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Registering the new language." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/register-language.png" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Finally, navigate to the languages folder and add the &lt;cite&gt;iecst.js&lt;/cite&gt; file. Here, for my
application, I had to make some modifications (which I documented fully in an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text/issues/9#issuecomment-685266264"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text/pull/10"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; on the source repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this long story longer, I'll be writing more later to document how my Marp
integration comes along. For the meantime, here's the takeaway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist for IEC 61131-3, and it'll become easier to implement
going forward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and how about what that syntax-highlighted code? What does it look like anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="An example of (nonsense) syntax-highlighted 61131 code." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/61131example.png" /&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to a very nice gentleman about a year ago who was demonstrating some
logic that created a .PNG file to demonstrate fault currents easily, and could be
attached in-line as part of an email body. What was so interesting to me is that this
all part of some logic that originated on an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://selinc.com/products/3530/"&gt;SEL RTAC&lt;/a&gt; using some of the functionality
in one of the many IEC 61131-3 libraries that are maintained by myself and the other
developers in the Automation Controllers Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the trouble with what this gentleman shared with me, is the reliance on an external
server to process the .CEV and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comtrade#:~:text=COMTRADE%20(Common%20format%20for%20Transient,to%20transient%20power%20system%20disturbances."&gt;COMTRADE&lt;/a&gt; files generated by monitored protective relays.
That was all well and good, but I still wasn't quite satisfied since there was a certain
amount of reliance on some other device. I wanted something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose at this point, I should take a step back. For those who don't eat, sleep, and
breath power systems engineering and electrical power system protection, an &amp;quot;event record&amp;quot;
is something of a novel idea. So what the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is an &amp;quot;event record?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you've asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a fault on a power system (like when you run into a power pole and it knocks down
one of the wires - those are bad days) causes all sorts of &amp;quot;bad behavior&amp;quot; on the electrical
system, and that bad behavior can be monitored and measured. It's what we use in the
traditional sense to detect faults in the first place and make a decision to open an
electrical breaker to shut off the power. Remember when you plugged in too many Christmas
lights and the breaker popped? It's the same idea, just at a much higher degree of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; have certain behavior, and engineers are often interested in characterizing
that behavior so that they can better understand not only what happened, but how it could
be prevented going forward. Back when Dr. Ed Schweitzer first invented the SEL-21 protective
relay (a conversation for another day), he added a very nifty little feature called &amp;quot;event
recording.&amp;quot; It added the ability to record information about the event when it occurred
so that someone could go back and analyze it at a later time. These event records contain
a lot of information, and they require special software to open them, to interpret them,
etcetera. Here's an example of what an event record might look like. This was taken from
a technical paper written titled &amp;quot;Numerical model framework of power quality events&amp;quot; by
Rodney Tan and Vigna Ramachandaramurthy; the full paper's linked below, so take a look if
you're so inclined!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="An example power system fault &amp;quot;Event Record&amp;quot;." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/power-system-fault.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290451701_Numerical_model_framework_of_power_quality_events"&gt;Tan, Rodney &amp;amp; Ramachandaramurthy, Vigna K.. (2010). Numerical model framework of power
quality events. 43. 30-47.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo, the idea that this gentleman and his team had crafted was to extract the
most interesting portion of the information and plug that into an image that could be made
part of an email. This way, a technician could easily look at the image and quickly make
decisions without having to load the full event record on a computer. This full analysis
could still be done later, but having the image available in the email might give an
engineer the ability to make quick decisions to help restore power to homes and families
more quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently completed some research where I've been able to effectively create a simple
RGB image in the Bitmap format (.BMP file) so that it can be used and interpreted by most
any computer available today. And should certainly allow for direct inclusion in emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this means that there's a good chance that technicians could effectively see
the report of an event without any advanced software, simply by opening their email client
on their smart phone. Talk about convenience. I've been doing some development and testing
and I found great value in this article from technical-recipes.com:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I'll be sharing more as I fully flesh out some design where I can effectively
create plots in a byte-array that can be stored as an image.&lt;/p&gt;

Just stand back.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm imagining the sound of an old-school electric motor grinding its way up to nominal
speed. Can you hear it? That low groan trying ever-so-hard to come up to a comfortable
range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should step back and introduce myself. I'm Joe Stanley, at the time of writing,
I'm twenty-three years old, and a graduate of the University of Idaho with both a Bachelors
and Masters in Electrical Engineering. I work with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL)
in Pullman, Washington. I spend far too much time trying to automate things that would have
been faster to do by hand; but I guess that's engineering. I'm an avid Pythonista, and I'm
always trying to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; others into the language. I also spend a great deal of time
developing and maintaining IEC 61131-3 libraries for SEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have far too many ideas and thoughts, so I think it's time to start sharing them. If it's
somewhere on the scale between sustainability and automation, I'm probably interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that I might start sharing thoughts, ideas, projects, and guides here on this
blog. Now, I'm sure you can hear that motor grinding up to speed!&lt;/p&gt;
