</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For any railfans, a train surrounding a Christmas tree is something of a given. But I recently
came up with a conundrum...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my house is becoming more and more of a &amp;quot;smart home,&amp;quot; and I'd like the Christmas holiday
to be much of the same. Now, that's pretty easy when it comes to the lights. Throw a smart-plug
running &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/"&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt; firmware (a free and open source alternative to the proprietary solutions) at
those lights, and let the magic commence. But for toy trains around the tree? That's a bit of a
different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why couldn't I just throw another smart plug at my toy trains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, but I don't really think that's the greatest idea. Reason being that
turning the trains on and off in a binary fashion (all or nothing) might not be great on them,
and wouldn't be the most pleasant sound either. I guess I could look at some of the solutions
that Lionel markets like their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lionel.com/brands/legacy/"&gt;Legacy&lt;/a&gt; or TMCC options, but that would mean a lot of new
purchases, research, and maybe some other annoyances that I'm just not too excited to deal with.
So, needless to say, that option's off the list too. Perhaps one of Lionel's new bluetooth
options? I guess, but that's kind of boring, don't you think? And to boot, if I were to follow
that route, I'd certainly need to buy a new locomotive, and I'd likely need to hack the remote.
Another option that I'm just not thrilled about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... well, what's left? My pickyness hasn't left me with many options, but I think there's
still &lt;em&gt;got to be something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="think-think-think"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think. Think. Think.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time thinking about my alternatives today, and well, let me just walk you through
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out thinking about the toy train transformer itself. That's all it really is, a
transformer; well, &lt;em&gt;variac&lt;/em&gt; specifically. A variac is just a variable transformer, essentially
a graphine brush that moves across the windings on the secondary side of a transformer. This
varying motion provides the variable &amp;quot;tap&amp;quot; on the transformer, and allows it to acheive a
voltage that can be varied and controlled to change the speed of the connected trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty simple really, Lionel and others pioneered this practice for the model and toy scene
nearly a century ago. Trouble is, the transformers (in my case, a Lionel ZW transformer) aren't
exactly built for modification, and like I mentioned earlier, I don't exactly idolize the thought
of tearing apart my toy train controls just to make them &amp;quot;smarter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Here's what a variac looks like..." src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91SL6j6kkNL._AC_SX425_.jpg" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time looking around for a cheap (I'd like to stay under $100 since I need to buy gifts,
too!) variac that is digitally controlled. No dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could buy a big variac and hook up a motor and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not gonna fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... well, what else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is a rheostat. For those of us who either forgot or skipped electrical machines in
college; a rheostat is basically a variable resistor. Similar to a variac, rheostats are typically
made from some form of wound wire that has a varying resistance as the user employs a sweeper to
move from one end to the other. That's really the big difference, and the reason it's not just
called a variable resistor, or even a potentiometer. Rheostats are basically &amp;quot;variable resistors
on steroids,&amp;quot; built for high-energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="And this is a rheostat..." src="https://cdn.images.fecom-media.com/A49116.jpg" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... yours truly started poking around online looking (once again) for a cheap electrical
device beefy enough to run toy trains, but not so big that it would break the bank. I bummed around
through Amazon with no luck, but after a quick search on eBay, I found something pretty enticing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess which toy train company just happened to make rheostats way back in the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right! Lionel rheostats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A Lionel rheostat!" src="https://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/SeymourAuctions/95/563895/H4246-L72135272.jpg" style="width: 450px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A solution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is that it? Just like that? Problem solved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes; but also, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lionel rheostats seem to be running about $10 and about as much in shipping on eBay at the time of
writing, so that's really good news. Not to mention the fact that they were built &lt;em&gt;specifically
for toy trains&lt;/em&gt; (score!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the fact that it's mechanical, not digital?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew you'd ask that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here, the big difference is the form factor. These rheostats are significantly easier to
interface with. Since they're linear, a single piece of all-thread-rod and a little stepper motor
could quite easily do just what I need. I could connect a little stepper motor to an ESP32/ESP8266
and hook that up to a Lionel rheostat via all-thread and a moving nut with a sweeper attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy-peasy! Well, sort-of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there's still quite a bit left on this one, and a good chance I won't actually do anything
about it this Christmas. Still, it's an exciting idea, and I'm definitely going to pursue it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, but stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, maybe I'll even throw a whistle control on there!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SEL Protocol is finally coming for Python. That's right, you've heard correctly; it's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The new... `selprotopy`!" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engineerjoe440/sel-proto-py/master/logo/selprotopy.png" style="width: 350px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what is SEL Protocol anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's a communications protocol, or standard, that was developed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://selinc.com/"&gt;SEL&lt;/a&gt; to support
fast data communications between protective electric relays (the devices that monitor the
power grid for faults) and communications processors. It was developed in the early '90s to
help improve communication support of devices to allow users to monitor protective relays
from a distance, and to perform control operations without being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've begun writing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/engineerjoe440/sel-proto-py"&gt;selprotopy&lt;/a&gt; which will be a protocol driver supporting SEL protocol in
Python. This means that users will be able to integrate solutions with SEL relays using
Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there's a lot to come, so this is not much more than an early announcement.
If you're interested in contributing, feel free to drop me a message! I'd love to interact!&lt;/p&gt;

And we KNOW that we can just hash out this great new thing. But where does that leave us the next time we want to do the same sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;C'mon, every developer has had that epiphany moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;I know, I can just write this thing now, and I'll have exactly what I need, and I'll
never need to touch it again; I'll never need to add more to it, and it will never
change.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish it worked that way, but let's be honest. Projects develop, add scope, change, and
sometimes, they morph into something new entirely. Actually, that's often where great code
comes from. The best projects are the butterflies of the development world. They start as
a simple little caterpillar, but at some point along the line, they change into something
far more elegant and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm writing this plea to developers out there in the &amp;quot;real world.&amp;quot; We know that
you could just write this little thing, but isn't it nice to get the &lt;em&gt;framework&lt;/em&gt; right the
first time so that when you need to revisit that code, it'll be so much easier. Or, better
yet, isn't it better to prepare the project for the &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;next guy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; who comes along to make
your framework into something incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I've devolved into rambling, as usual, but my point is this: when you spend the time
to develop the framework &lt;em&gt;the right way&lt;/em&gt; the first time, you and all of your colleagues will
thank you. It will make things just &lt;strong&gt;that much easier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a handful of experiences with this myself. I started on a couple projects at work
where I developed something that I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; was a great system, and didn't really require
a superior framework. This inevitably saved time in the short-term, but it bit me later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, I recently realized that I was re-writing the same code over, and over,
and over again every time I had to touch the code. In the end, as it seems, I didn't spend
enough time writing the framework to begin, and that hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="here-s-the-takeaway"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here's the Takeaway:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we all love just &amp;quot;pulling in&amp;quot; a library that does the &amp;quot;dirty work&amp;quot; for us.
I think it's time that we focus on getting those libraries right from the onset, so we don't
need to keep re-doing our own work, or the work of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say drop me a note in the comments, but I haven't quite gotten that set up yet. So, for
now, just keep fighting the good fight, and &lt;em&gt;write those libraries!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What about if sound were a part of it too?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm very pleased to say that I'm helping to support some really exciting research at
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://uidaho.edu"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a couple of my classmates worked on
a truly exciting project that utilized some relatively new sensory technology in conjunction
with some wireless network technology (Zigbee radios) to communicate infrasound (below the
audible range for humans) signatures back for scientists to analyze. These signatures will
inform scientists and firefighters, alike, when (and where) a wildfire has started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this was all well and good, but the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mindworks.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Infrasound_in_wildfire"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; lost funding. Yep. Just like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm so excited to be getting involved. We've already got a team of four fantastic
engineers. A mechanical engineer, two electrical engineers, and a computer scientist. With
luck the group will be able to start some fantastic research that could eventually lead to a
truly exciting product that may help wildland firefighters around the country (and around the
world) find fires &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; and with greater accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group is just getting started, but I'm very excited to see where things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-techy-side"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Techy Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is this supposed to work anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we've all heard stories about how animals can sense an impending natural disaster, and
in fact, that's quite true with wildfire. Most wild game (and many domesticated species too)
have much more astute hearing sense. In fact, they can hear the low-frequency sounds that
we're unable to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensors we're hoping to utilize will allow our digital system to detect the low-frequency
rumble of wild fire, then with digital signal processing, we'll aim to identify audio
signatures unique to wildfire. With this, we'll be able to detect fire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the goal will be to create a mesh-network of devices covering the forest floor in
areas such that devices will be able to communicate amongst themselves to precisely locate
the fire, and to report it to the authorities quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been investigating some new resources for high-level documentation, including
automated presentation builders, and along the way, a question arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to demonstrate code examples for IEC 61131-3, is there a way that I can provide
syntax highlighting so that readers will be able to understand the material more clearly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is syntax highlighting anyway? Well, for code snippets, syntax highlighting uses
various colors and fonts to isolate the unique keywords, operators, and other items that
are standard in that particular programming language. I'll show an example here momentarily.
This is very useful because it allows readers to quickly interpret what the code is
intentionally doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough that I was able to find a project that was already providing syntax
highlighting for IEC 61131-3 in the &lt;cite&gt;highlight.js&lt;/cite&gt; project framework (though not natively)
and thus, I could leverage existing work! Trouble is, since it's not already a native
&amp;quot;language&amp;quot; it comes with its own set of challenges. The source of this highlighter comes
from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text"&gt;GitHub highlightjs Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My challenge was identifying an effective way of declaring the language so that I could
use it with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marp-team/marpit"&gt;Marpit&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the Marp project; a system built to convert
markdown files to HTML or PPTX presentations. (Be on the lookout for an upcoming article
on this topic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much trial and tribulation, I finally realized a solution. Since I was using
&lt;cite&gt;highlight.js&lt;/cite&gt; as a required module in the marp framework, I could simply add the language
definition and register it accordingly. Here are the steps I took to modify my installation
to make it work as I wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Locate existing highlight.js installation location by finding dependent module (in my
case marp). Then open directory (since I'm using Windows, I can use
&lt;cite&gt;Explorer &amp;lt;path/to/marp/directory&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Identify the install location." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/61131-highlighting/cmd-view.png" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Navigate to the directory containing the module of interest, then navigate to the
&lt;cite&gt;node_modules/highlight.js&lt;/cite&gt; folder underneath the desired module. In my case, since
I'm using marp-cli, I navigated to
&lt;cite&gt;node_modules/&amp;#64;marp-team/marp-cli/node_modules/highlight.js/lib&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Locate the `index.js` file for modification." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/61131-highlighting/explorer-view.png" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Open the &lt;cite&gt;index.js&lt;/cite&gt; file in a text editor and add a new line to register the &lt;cite&gt;iecst&lt;/cite&gt;
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Registering the new language." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/61131-highlighting/register-language.png" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Finally, navigate to the languages folder and add the &lt;cite&gt;iecst.js&lt;/cite&gt; file. Here, for my
application, I had to make some modifications (which I documented fully in an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text/issues/9#issuecomment-685266264"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text/pull/10"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; on the source repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this long story longer, I'll be writing more later to document how my Marp
integration comes along. For the meantime, here's the takeaway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist for IEC 61131-3, and it'll become easier to implement
going forward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and how about what that syntax-highlighted code? What does it look like anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="An example of (nonsense) syntax-highlighted 61131 code." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/61131-highlighting/61131example.png" /&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to a very nice gentleman about a year ago who was demonstrating some
logic that created a .PNG file to demonstrate fault currents easily, and could be
attached in-line as part of an email body. What was so interesting to me is that this
all part of some logic that originated on an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://selinc.com/products/3530/"&gt;SEL RTAC&lt;/a&gt; using some of the functionality
in one of the many IEC 61131-3 libraries that are maintained by myself and the other
developers in the Automation Controllers Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the trouble with what this gentleman shared with me, is the reliance on an external
server to process the .CEV and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comtrade#:~:text=COMTRADE%20(Common%20format%20for%20Transient,to%20transient%20power%20system%20disturbances."&gt;COMTRADE&lt;/a&gt; files generated by monitored protective relays.
That was all well and good, but I still wasn't quite satisfied since there was a certain
amount of reliance on some other device. I wanted something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose at this point, I should take a step back. For those who don't eat, sleep, and
breath power systems engineering and electrical power system protection, an &amp;quot;event record&amp;quot;
is something of a novel idea. So what the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is an &amp;quot;event record?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you've asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a fault on a power system (like when you run into a power pole and it knocks down
one of the wires - those are bad days) causes all sorts of &amp;quot;bad behavior&amp;quot; on the electrical
system, and that bad behavior can be monitored and measured. It's what we use in the
traditional sense to detect faults in the first place and make a decision to open an
electrical breaker to shut off the power. Remember when you plugged in too many Christmas
lights and the breaker popped? It's the same idea, just at a much higher degree of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; have certain behavior, and engineers are often interested in characterizing
that behavior so that they can better understand not only what happened, but how it could
be prevented going forward. Back when Dr. Ed Schweitzer first invented the SEL-21 protective
relay (a conversation for another day), he added a very nifty little feature called &amp;quot;event
recording.&amp;quot; It added the ability to record information about the event when it occurred
so that someone could go back and analyze it at a later time. These event records contain
a lot of information, and they require special software to open them, to interpret them,
etcetera. Here's an example of what an event record might look like. This was taken from
a technical paper written titled &amp;quot;Numerical model framework of power quality events&amp;quot; by
Rodney Tan and Vigna Ramachandaramurthy; the full paper's linked below, so take a look if
you're so inclined!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="An example power system fault &amp;quot;Event Record&amp;quot;." src="https://engineerjoe440.github.io/stanley-solutions-blog/images/power-system-fault.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290451701_Numerical_model_framework_of_power_quality_events"&gt;Tan, Rodney &amp;amp; Ramachandaramurthy, Vigna K.. (2010). Numerical model framework of power
quality events. 43. 30-47.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo, the idea that this gentleman and his team had crafted was to extract the
most interesting portion of the information and plug that into an image that could be made
part of an email. This way, a technician could easily look at the image and quickly make
decisions without having to load the full event record on a computer. This full analysis
could still be done later, but having the image available in the email might give an
engineer the ability to make quick decisions to help restore power to homes and families
more quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently completed some research where I've been able to effectively create a simple
RGB image in the Bitmap format (.BMP file) so that it can be used and interpreted by most
any computer available today. And should certainly allow for direct inclusion in emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this means that there's a good chance that technicians could effectively see
the report of an event without any advanced software, simply by opening their email client
on their smart phone. Talk about convenience. I've been doing some development and testing
and I found great value in this article from technical-recipes.com:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I'll be sharing more as I fully flesh out some design where I can effectively
create plots in a byte-array that can be stored as an image.&lt;/p&gt;

Just stand back.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm imagining the sound of an old-school electric motor grinding its way up to nominal
speed. Can you hear it? That low groan trying ever-so-hard to come up to a comfortable
range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should step back and introduce myself. I'm Joe Stanley, at the time of writing,
I'm twenty-three years old, and a graduate of the University of Idaho with both a Bachelors
and Masters in Electrical Engineering. I work with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL)
in Pullman, Washington. I spend far too much time trying to automate things that would have
been faster to do by hand; but I guess that's engineering. I'm an avid Pythonista, and I'm
always trying to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; others into the language. I also spend a great deal of time
developing and maintaining IEC 61131-3 libraries for SEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have far too many ideas and thoughts, so I think it's time to start sharing them. If it's
somewhere on the scale between sustainability and automation, I'm probably interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that I might start sharing thoughts, ideas, projects, and guides here on this
blog. Now, I'm sure you can hear that motor grinding up to speed!&lt;/p&gt;
