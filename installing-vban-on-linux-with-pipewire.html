    <h3>Reason for being here.</h3>
<p>That's right, I'm finally moving away from Windows as my daily driver at home. Making the move
to Kubuntu. I'm much happier with the change, but I do need to fix a reasonable set of things
and get VBAN working to make sure that my audio is still uninterrupted!</p>
<p>What's <code>VBAN</code>, you ask? Well, go check out my other articles:

<p>In a nutshell, however, I use VBAN as a low-latency audio networking solution for my home.
It's really helped to bring whole-home audio together quite nicely. Analog can still be "easier"
in some regards, but it's more time and effor to run those wires, sometimes.</p>
<h3>Installing VBAN</h3>
<p>This hasn't really changed all that much since my article about
<a href="https://blog.stanleysolutionsnw.com/networked-audio-using-vban-and-rpi.html">installing VBAN on the Raspberry Pi</a>. It starts with installing the basics.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>libasound-dev<span class="w"> </span>autoconf<span class="w"> </span>automake
</code></pre></div>

<p>Cloning the repository...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/quiniouben/vban.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>Running the autogen script...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>./autogen.sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>Setting up for only alsa...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>./configure<span class="w"> </span>--enable-alsa<span class="w"> </span>--disable-pulseaudio<span class="w"> </span>--disable-jack
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then install with <code>make</code> like the <a href="https://github.com/quiniouben/vban">docs</a> show.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wanna just run one script? Yeah, me too...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/bash</span>
sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt-get<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>libasound2-dev<span class="w"> </span>autoconf<span class="w"> </span>automake<span class="w"> </span>-y

<span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>/home/<span class="k">$(</span>whoami<span class="k">)</span>/Downloads

git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/quiniouben/vban.git

<span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>vban

./autogen.sh

./configure<span class="w"> </span>--enable-alsa<span class="w"> </span>--disable-pulseaudio<span class="w"> </span>--disable-jack

make

<span class="c1"># I needed sudo, you might not? Too lazy to bother checking...</span>
sudo<span class="w"> </span>make<span class="w"> </span>install
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Getting Alsa Working?</h2>
<p>Well... that's the next step. I seem to be having "fun" with that, again. I'll have to
dig around some more. I'm leaving this post incomplete, because I want to report back when I get
the darned thing working.</p>

<p>... more soon ...</p>
